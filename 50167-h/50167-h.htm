<p>September 12, 1867, Tennessee, Delaware, Maryland, Missouri,
Kentucky, and the District of Columbia were fully represented in
what was called “the Border State Convention,” which assembled
in the Front Street Theatre, Baltimore. The object, in the language
of the call, was “to advance the cause of manhood suffrage, and to
demand of Congress the passage of the Sumner-Wilson bill.” The
following letter from Mr. Sumner was read to the Convention.</p>

<p>Congress will leave undone what it ought to do,
if it fails to provide promptly for the establishment
of Equal Rights, whether political or civil, everywhere
throughout the Union. This is a solemn duty, not to
be shirked or postponed.</p>

<p>The idea is intolerable, that any State, under any
pretension of State Rights, can set up <i>a political oligarchy</i>
within its borders, and then call itself a republican
government. I insist with all my soul that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>

<p>He took this occasion to repeat, that, notwithstanding his solicitude

<p>The Declaration of Independence having provided for the <i>national</i> character
and the <i>national</i> powers, it remained in some mode to provide for
the character and powers of the States individually, as a consequence of
the dissolution of the colonial system. Accordingly the people of each
State set themselves to work, under a recommendation from Congress,
to erect a local government for themselves; but in no instance did the
people of any State attempt to incorporate into their local system any
of those attributes of national authority which the Declaration of Independence
had asserted in favor of the United States.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alexander

<p>America has chosen to be, in many respects and to many purposes, a
Nation; and for all these purposes her government is complete, to all
these objects it is competent. The people have declared, that, in the exercise
of all powers given for these objects, it is supreme. It can, then,
in effecting these objects, legitimately control all individuals or governments
within the American territory. The Constitution and laws of a
State, so far as they are repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the
United States, are absolutely void. These States are constituent parts
of the United States; they are members of one great empire.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chief

<p>This Address was prepared as a lecture, and was delivered on a
lecture-tour reaching as far as Milwaukee, Dubuque, and St. Louis.
On its delivery in New York, Dr. Francis Lieber was in the chair.
It became the subject of various local notice and discussion.</p>

<p>The idea of Nationality had prevailed with Mr. Sumner from the
beginning of his public life. In his appeal to Mr. Webster before
the Whig State Convention, as early as September 23, 1846, while
calling on the eminent Senator and orator to become <i>Defender of Humanity</i>,
he recognized his received title, <i>Defender of the Constitution</i>,
as justly earned by the vigor, argumentation, and eloquence with
which he had “upheld the Union and that interpretation of the Constitution
which makes us a Nation.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And from that time he had
always insisted that we were a Nation,&mdash;believing, that, while many
things were justly left to local government, for which the States are the
natural organs, yet the great principles of Unity and Human Rights
should be placed under central guardianship, so as to be everywhere
the same; and this he considered the essence of the Nation.&mdash;The
word “Federal” Mr. Sumner habitually rejected for “National.”
Courts and officers under the United States Government he called
“National.”</p>

<h3>ADDRESS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;At the close of a bloody Rebellion,
instigated by hostility to the sacred principles
of the Declaration of Independence, and inaugurated
in the name of State Rights, it becomes us now
to do our best that these sacred principles shall not
again be called in question, and that State Rights shall
not again disturb the national repose. One terrible war
is more than enough; and since, after struggle, peril, and
sacrifice, where every household has been a sufferer, we
are at last victorious, it is not too much to insist on
all possible safeguards for the future. The whole case
must be settled now. The constant duel between the
Nation and the States must cease. The National Unity
must be assured,&mdash;in the only way which is practical
and honest,&mdash;through the principles declared by our
fathers and inwoven into the national life.</p>

<p>In one word, the Declaration of Independence must
be recognized as a fundamental law, and State Rights,
in all their denationalizing pretensions, must be trampled
out forever, to the end that we may be, in reality
as in name, a Nation.</p>

<p>Are we a Nation? Such is the question I now propose,
believing that the whole case is involved in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
answer. Are we a Nation? Then must we have that
essential, indestructible unity belonging to a Nation,
with all those central, pervasive, impartial powers which
minister to the national life; then must we have that
central, necessary authority inherent in just government,
to protect the citizen in all the rights of citizenship;
and then must we have that other central, inalienable
prerogative of providing for all the promises solemnly
made when we first claimed our place as a Nation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Words are sometimes things; and I cannot doubt
that our country would gain in strength and our people
in comprehensive patriotism, if we discarded language
which in itself implies certain weakness and possible
disunion. Pardon me, if I confess that I have
never reconciled myself to the use of the word “Federal”
instead of “National.” To my mind, our government
is not Federal, but National; our Constitution is
not Federal, but National; our courts under the Constitution
are not Federal, but National; our army is
not Federal, but National. There is one instance where
this misnomer does not occur. The debt of our country
is always <i>National</i>,&mdash;perhaps because this term
promises in advance additional security to the anxious
creditor. “Liberty” and “Equality” are more than dollars
and cents; they should be National also, and enjoy
the same security.</p>

<p>During the imbecility of the Confederation, which
was nothing but a league or <i>fœdus</i>, the government
was naturally called Federal. This was its proper designation.
Any other would have been out of place,
although even then Washington liked to speak of the
Nation. In summoning the Convention which framed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the National Constitution, the States all spoke of the
existing government as “Federal.” But after the adoption
of the National Constitution, completing our organization
as one people, the designation was inappropriate.
It should have been changed. If not then, it
must be now. New capacities require a new name. The
word Saviour did not originally exist in the Latin; but
St. Augustine, who wrote in this language, boldly used
it, saying there was no occasion for it until after the
Saviour was born.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> If among us in the earlier day
there was no occasion for the word Nation, there is
now. A Nation is born.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The word Nation is suggestive beyond any definition
of the dictionary. It awakens an echo second only to
that of Country. It is a word of unity and power. It
brings to mind intelligent masses enjoying the advantage
of organization, for whom there is a Law of Nations,&mdash;as
there is a Law of Nature,&mdash;each nation
being a unit. Sometimes uttered vaguely, it is simply
an intensive, as in the familiar exaggeration, “only a
<i>nation</i> louder”; but even here the word furnishes a
measure of vastness. In ordinary usage, it implies an
aggregation of human beings who have reached such
advanced stage of political development that they are
no longer a tribe of Nomads, like our Indians,&mdash;no
longer a mere colony, city, principality, or state,&mdash;but
they are one people, throbbing with a common life,
occupying a common territory, rejoicing in a common
history, sharing in common trials, and securing to each
the protection of the common power. We have heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
also, that a Nation is a people with the consciousness
of Human Rights. Well spoke Louis the Fifteenth of
France, when this word first resounded in his ears:
“What means it? I am king; is there any king but
me?” The monarch did not know that the Nation
was more than king, all of which his successor learned
among the earliest lessons of the Revolution, as this
word became the inspiration and voice of France.</p>

<p>The ancients had but one word for State and City;
nor did they use the word Nation as it is latterly
used. Derived from the Latin <i>nascor</i> and <i>natus</i>, signifying
“to be born” and “being born,” it was originally
applied to a race or people of common descent and
language, but seems to have had no reference to a
common government. In the latter sense it is modern.
Originally ethnological, it is now political. The
French Communists have popularized the kindred word
“Solidarity,” denoting a community of interests, which
is an element of nationality. There is the solidarity
of nations together, and also the solidarity of a people
constituting one nation, being those who, according to
a familiar phrase, are “all in one bottom.”</p>

<p>England early became a Nation; and this word seems
to have assumed there a corresponding meaning. Sir
Walter Raleigh, courtier of Queen Elizabeth, and victim
of James the First, who was a master of our language,
in speaking of the people of England, calls them
“our Nation.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> John Milton was filled with the same
sentiment, when, addressing England and Scotland, he
says: “Go on, both hand in hand, <i>O Nations</i>, never to
be disunited! be the praise and the heroic song of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
posterity!”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the time of Charles the Second, Sir
William Temple furnished a precise definition, which
foreshadows the definition of our day. According to
this accomplished writer and diplomatist, a Nation was
“a great number of families, derived from the same
blood, born in the same country, and <i>living under the
same government and civil constitutions</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Here is the
political element. Johnson, in his Dictionary, follows
Temple substantially, calling it “a people distinguished
from another people, generally by their language, original,
<i>or government</i>.” Our own Webster, the lexicographer,
calls it “the body of inhabitants of a country <i>united
under the same government</i>”; Worcester, “a people born
in the same country and <i>living under the same government</i>”;
the French Dictionary of the Academy, “the
totality of persons born or naturalized in a country and
<i>living under the same government</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Of these definitions,
those of Webster and the French Academy are
the best; and of the two, that of Webster the most
compact.</p>

<p>These definitions all end in the idea of unity under
one government. They contemplate political unity,
rather than unity of blood or language. Undoubted
nations exist without the latter. Various accents of
speech and various types of manhood, with the great
distinction of color, which we encounter daily, show
that there is no such unity here. But this is not required.
If the inhabitants are of one blood and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
language, the unity is more complete; but the essential
condition is one sovereignty, involving, of course,
one citizenship. In this sense Gibbon employs the
word, when, describing the people of Italy,&mdash;all of
whom were recognized as Roman citizens,&mdash;he says:
“From the foot of the Alps to the extremity of Calabria,
all the natives of Italy were born citizens of
Rome. Their partial distinctions were obliterated, and
they insensibly <i>coalesced into one great Nation</i>, united
by language, manners, and <i>civil institutions</i>, and equal
to the weight of a powerful empire.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Here dominion
proceeding originally from conquest is consecrated by
concession of citizenship, and the great historian hails
the coalesced people as Nation.</p>

<p>One of our ablest writers of History and Constitutional
Law, Professor Lieber, of Columbia College, New
York, has discussed this question with learning and
power.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> According to this eminent authority, Nation
is something more than a word. It denotes that polity
which is the normal type of government at the present
advanced stage of civilization, and to which all
people tend just in proportion to enlightenment and
enfranchisement. The learned Professor does not hesitate
to say that such a polity is naturally dedicated
to the maintenance of all the rights of the citizen as
its practical end and object. It is easy to see that the
Nation, thus defined, must possess elements of perpetuity.
It is not a quicksand, or mere agglomeration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of particles, liable to disappear, but a solid, infrangible
crystallization, against which winds and rains beat in
vain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Opposed to this prevailing tendency is the earlier
propensity to local sovereignty, which is so gratifying
to petty pride and ambition. This propensity, assuming
various forms in different ages and countries,
according to the degree of development, has always
been a species of egotism. When the barbarous islanders
of the Pacific imagined themselves the whole world,
they furnished an illustration of this egotism in its
primitive form. Its latest manifestation has been in
State pretensions. But here a distinction must be observed.
For purposes of local self-government, and to
secure its educational and political blessings, the States
are of unquestioned value. This is their true function,
to be praised and vindicated always. But <i>local sovereignty</i>,
whether in the name of State or prince, is
out of place and incongruous under a government truly
national. It is entirely inconsistent with the idea of
Nation. Perhaps its essential absurdity in such a government
was never better illustrated than by the homely
apologue of the ancient Roman,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which so wrought upon
the secessionists of his day that they at once returned
to their allegiance. According to this successful orator,
the different members of the human body once murmured
against the “belly,” which was pictured very
much as our National Government has been, and they
severally refused all further coöperation. The hands
would not carry food to the mouth; nor would the
mouth receive it, if carried; nor would the teeth perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
their office. The rebellion began; but each member
soon found that its own welfare was bound up inseparably
with the rest, and especially that in weakening
the “belly” it weakened every part. Such is the
discord of State pretensions. How unlike that unity
of which the human form, with heaven-directed countenance,
is the perfect type, where every part has its
function, and all are in obedience to the divine mandate
which created man in the image of God! And
such is the Nation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Would you know the incalculable mischief of State
pretensions? The American continent furnishes three
different examples, each worthy of extended contemplation.
There are, first, our Indians, aborigines of the
soil, split into tribes, possessing a barbarous independence,
but through this perverse influence kept in constant
strife, with small chance of improvement. Each
chief is a representative of State pretensions. Turning
the back upon union, they turn the back upon civilization
itself. There is, next, our neighbor republic,
Mexico, where Nature is bountiful in vain, and climate
lends an unavailing charm, while twenty-three States,
unwilling to recognize the national power, set up their
disorganizing pretensions, and chaos becomes chronic.
The story is full of darkness and tragedy. The other
instance is our own, where sacrifices of all kinds, public
and private, rise up in blood before us. Civil war,
wasted treasure, debt, wounds, and death are the witnesses.
With wailing voice all these cry out against
the deadly enemy lurking in State pretensions. But
this wail is heard from the beginning of history, saddening
its pages from generation to generation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>In ancient times the City-State was the highest type,
as in Greece, where every city was a State, proud of
its miniature sovereignty. The natural consequences
ensued. Alliances, leagues, and confederations were ineffectual
against State pretensions. The parts failed to
recognize the whole and its natural supremacy. Amidst
all the triumphs of genius and the splendors of art,
there was no national life, and Greece died. From her
venerable sepulchre, with ever-burning funeral lamps,
where was buried so much of mortal beauty, there is
a constant voice of warning, which sounds across continent
and ocean, echoing “Beware!”</p>

<p>Rome also was a City-State. If it assumed at any
time the national form, it was only because the conquering
republic took to itself all other communities
and melted them in its fiery crucible. But this dominion
was of force, ending in universal empire, where the
consent of the governed was of little account. How incalculably
different from a well-ordered Nation, where
all is natural, and the people are knit together in self-imposed
bonds!</p>

<p>Then came the colossal power of Charlemagne, under
whom peoples and provinces were accumulated into
one incongruous mass. Here again was universal empire,
but there was no Nation.</p>

<p>Legend and song have depicted the paladins that
surrounded Charlemagne, fighting his battles and constituting
his court. They were the beginning of that
Feudal System which was the next form that Europe
assumed. The whole country was parcelled among
chieftains under the various names of Duke, Count,
and Baron, each of whom held a district, great or small,
where, asserting a local sovereignty, he revelled in State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
pretensions; and yet they all professed a common allegiance.
Guizot was the first to remark that Feudalism,
taken as a whole, was a confederation, which he
boldly likens to what he calls the federal system of the
United States. It is true that Feudalism was essentially
federal, where each principality exercised a disturbing
influence, and unity was impossible; but I utterly deny
that our country can fall into any such category, unless
it succumbs at last to the dogma of State pretensions,
which was the essential element of the feudal confederation.</p>

<p>Feudalism was not a government; it was only a system.
During its prevalence, the Nation was unknown.
Wherever its influence subsided, the Nation began to
appear; and now, wherever its influence still lingers on
earth, there the yearnings for national life, instinctive
in the popular heart, are for the time suppressed.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Sweden and Hungary were not
brought within the sphere of Feudalism, and these two
outlying lands, left free to natural impulses, revealed
themselves at an early day as Nations. When the European
continent was weakened by anarchy, they were
already strong in national life, with an influence beyond
their population or means.</p>

<p>Feudalism has left its traces in England; but it was
never sufficiently strong in that sea-girt land to resist
the natural tendencies to unity, partly from its insular
position, and partly from the character of its people.
At an early day the seven-headed Heptarchy was
changed into one kingdom; but a transformation not
less important occurred when the feudal lords were absorbed
into the government, of which they became a
component part, and the people were represented in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a central Parliament, which legislated for the whole
country, with Magna Charta as the supreme law. Then
was England a Nation; and just in proportion as the
national life increased has her sway been felt in the
world.</p>

<p>France was less prompt to undergo this change, for
Feudalism found here its favorite home. That compact
country, so formed for unity, was the victim of State
pretensions. It was divided and subdivided. North
and South, speaking the same language, were separated
by a difference of dialect. Then came the great provinces,
Normandy, Brittany, Burgundy, Provence, Languedoc,
and Gascony, with constant menace of resistance
and nullification, while smaller fiefs shared the
prevailing turbulence. A French barony was an “autonomic
government,” with a moated town, in contrast
with an English barony, which was merged in the Kingdom.
Slowly these denationalizing pretensions were
subdued; but at last the flag of the French monarchy,&mdash;the
most beautiful invention of heraldry,&mdash;with
lilies of gold on a field of azure, and angelic supporters,
waved over a united people. From that time France
has been a Nation, filled with a common life, burning
with a common patriotism, and quickened by a common
glory. To an Arab chieftain, who, in barbaric
simplicity, asked the number of tribes there, a Frenchman
promptly replied, “We are all one tribe.”</p>

<p>Spain also triumphed over State pretensions. The
Moors were driven from Granada. Castile and Aragon
were united under Ferdinand and Isabella. Feudalism
was overcome. Strong in the national unity, her kings
became lords of the earth. The name of Spain was
exalted, and her language was carried to the uttermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
parts of the sea. For her Columbus sailed; for her
Cortes and Pizarro conquered. But these adventurous
spirits could have done little, had they not been filled
with the exuberance of her national life.</p>

<p>Italy has been less happy. The pretensions of Feudalism
here commingled with the pretensions of City-States.
Petty princes and petty republics, restless with
local sovereignty, constituted together a perpetual discord.
That beauty which one of her poets calls a “fatal
gift” tempted the foreigner. Disunited Italy became
an easy prey. Genius strove in the bitterness of despair,
while this exquisite land, where History adds to
the charms of Nature and gilds anew the golden fields,
sank at last to become, in the audacious phrase of Napoleon,
simply a geographical name. A checker-board
of separate States, it was little else. It had a place
on the map, as in the memory, but no place in the
present. It performed no national part. It did nothing
for imitation or remembrance. Thus it continued,
a fearful example to mankind. Meanwhile the sentiment
of Nationality began to stir. At last it broke
forth like the pent-up lava from its own Vesuvius, and
Garibaldi was its conductor. Separate States, renouncing
local pretensions, became greater still as parts of
the great whole, and Italy stood forth a Nation, to testify
against the intolerable jargon of State pretensions. All
hail to this heroic revival, where dissevered parts have
been brought together, as were those of the ancient
Deity, and shaped anew into a form of beauty and
power!</p>

<p>But Germany is the most instructive example. Here,
from generation to generation, have State pretensions
triumphed, perversely postponing that National Unity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
which is the longing of the German heart. Stretching
from the Baltic to the Adriatic and the Alps, penetrated
by great rivers, possessing an harmonious expanse
of territory, speaking one language, filled with
the same intellectual life, and enjoying a common name,
which has been historic from the days of Tacitus, Germany,
like France, seems formed for unity. Martin Luther
addressed one of his grand letters <i>An die Deutsche
Nation</i> (To the German Nation); and these words are
always touching to Germans as the image of what they
desire so much. Thus far the great longing has failed.
Even the Empire, where all were gathered under one
imperial head, was only a variegated patchwork of
States. Feudalism, in its most extravagant pretensions,
still prevails. Confederation takes the place of Nationality,
and this vast country, with all its elements of
unity, is only a discordant conglomerate. North and
South are inharmonious, Prussia and Austria representing
two opposite sections. Other divisions have been
more perplexing. Not to speak of Circles, or groups,
each with a diet of its own, which once existed, I mention
simply the later division into thirty-nine States,
differing in government and in extent, being monarchies,
principalities, dukedoms, and free cities, all proportionately
represented in a general council or diet,
and proportionately bound to the common defence, but
every one filled with State egotism. So complete was
this disjunction, and such its intolerable pretensions,
that internal commerce, the life-blood of the Nation,
was strangled. Down to a recent day, each diminutive
state had its own custom-house, where the traveller
was compelled to exhibit his passport and submit
to local levies. This universal obstruction slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
yielded to a Zollverein, or Customs-Union, under which
these barriers were obliterated and customs were collected
on the external frontiers. Here was the first
triumph of Unity. Meanwhile the perpetual strife between
Prussia and Austria broke out in terrible battle.
Prussia has succeeded in absorbing several of the
smaller states. But the darling passion of the German
heart is still unsatisfied. Not in fact, but in aspiration
only, is Germany one nation. Patriot Poetry takes up
the voice, and, scorning the claims of individual states,
principalities, and cities, scorning also the larger claims
of Prussia and Austria alike, exclaims, in the spirit of
a true Nationality:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Confessing the necessity of a true national life, we
have considered what is a Nation, and how the word
itself implies indestructible unity under one government
with common rights of citizenship; and then we
have seen how this idea has grown with the growth
of civilization, slowly conquering the adverse pretensions
of States, until at last even Italy became one
nation, while Germany was left still struggling for the
same victory. And now I come again to the question
with which I began.</p>

<p>Are we a Nation? Surely we are not a City-State,
like Athens and early Rome in antiquity, or like Florence
and Frankfort in modern times; nor, whatever
the extent of our territory, are we an Empire cemented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by conquest, like that of later Rome, or like that of
Charlemagne; nor are we a Feudal Confederation, with
territory parcelled among local pretenders; nor are we
a Confederation in any just sense. From the first settlement
of the country down to the present time, whether
in the long annals of the Colonies or since the Colonies
were changed into States, there has been but one authentic
voice: now breaking forth in organized effort
for Union; now swelling in that majestic utterance of
a united people, the Declaration of Independence; now
sounding in the scarcely less majestic utterance of the
same united people, the opening words of the National
Constitution; and then again leaping from the hearts
of patriots. All these, at different times and in various
tones, testify that we are one people, under one sovereignty,
vitalized and elevated by a dedication to Human
Rights.</p>

<p>There is a distinction for a long time recognized
by German writers, and denoted by the opposite terms
<i>Staatenbund</i> and <i>Bundesstaat</i>,&mdash;the former being “a
league of states,” and the latter “a state formed by a
league.” In the former the separate states are visibly
distinct; in the latter they are lost in unity. And
such is the plain condition of our republic.</p>

<p>Of the present thirty-seven States only thirteen
were originally Colonies; three are offsets from some
of these; all the rest have been founded on territory
which was the common property of the people of the
United States, and at their own request they have been
received into the fellowship of government and citizenship.
If on any ground one of the original Thirteen
might renounce its obligations to the Union, it would
not follow that one of the new States, occupying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
common territory, could do likewise. It is little short
of madness to attribute such a denationalizing prerogative
to any State, whether new or old. For better or
worse, we are all bound together in one indissoluble
bond. The National Union is a knot which in an evil
hour the sword may cut, but which no mortal power
can unloose without the common consent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the earliest landing, this knot has been tying
tighter and tighter. Two ways it promptly showed itself:
first, in the common claim of the rights of British
subjects; and, secondly, in the common rights of
citizenship coextensive with the Colonies, and the consequent
rights of every Colony in every other Colony.</p>

<p>The Colonies were settled separately, under different
names, and each had its own local government. But
no local government in any Colony was allowed to restrict
the rights, liberties, and immunities of British
subjects. This was often declared. Above all charters
or local laws were the imprescriptible safeguards
of Magna Charta, which were common to all the inhabitants.
On one occasion, the Legislature of Massachusetts
reminded the king’s governor of these safeguards
in memorable words: “We hope we may without
offence put your Excellency in mind of that most
grievous sentence of excommunication solemnly denounced
by the Church in the name of the sacred Trinity,
in the presence of King Henry the Third and the
estates of the realm, <i>against all those who should make
statutes, or observe them, being made, contrary to the liberties
of Magna Charta</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Massachusetts spoke for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the Colonies. Enjoyment of common rights was a common
bond, constituting an element of nationality. As
these rights grew more important, the common bond
grew stronger.</p>

<p>The rights of citizenship in the Colonies were derived
from common relations to the mother country. No Colonist
could be an alien in any other Colony. As British
subject he had the freedom of every Colony, with
the right of making his home there, and of inheriting
lands. Among all the Colonies there was a common
and interchangeable citizenship, or <i>inter-citizenship</i>.
The very rule of the Constitution then began,
that “the citizens of each State shall be entitled to
all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several
States.” Here was another element of nationality.
If not at that time fellow-citizens, all were at least
fellow-subjects. Fellowship had begun. Thus in the
earliest days, even before Independence, were the Colonists
one people, with one sovereignty, afterwards renounced.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Efforts for a common government on this side of the
ocean soon showed themselves. The Pilgrims landed at
Plymouth in 1620. As early as 1643, only twenty-three
years later, there was a confederation under the name
of “The United Colonies of New England,” formed primarily
for the common defence; and here is the first
stage of nationality on this continent. In the preamble
to the Articles the parties declare: “We, therefore,
do conceive it our bounden duty without delay to enter
into a present consociation amongst ourselves for mutual
help and strength in all our future concernments,
that, as in nation and religion, so in other respects, <i>we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
be and continue One</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Better words could not mark
the beginning of a nation. A distinguished character
of the time, recording the difficulties encountered by
the Articles, says: “But, being all desirous of union and
studious of peace, they readily yielded each to other
in such things as tended to common utility, etc., so as
in some two or three meetings <i>they lovingly accorded</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Encouraged by “loving accord,” another proposition was
brought forward in Massachusetts, “for all the English
within the United Colonies <i>to enter into a civil agreement
for the maintenance of religion and our civil liberties</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
More than a century elapsed before this aspiration
was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Colonies grew in population and power.
No longer merely scattered settlements, they began to
act a part in history. Anxious especially against French
domination, already existing in Canada and extending
along the Lakes to the Mississippi, they came together
in Congress at Albany, in 1754, to take measures for the
common defence. Delegates were present from seven
Colonies, being all north of the Potomac. Here the
genius of Benjamin Franklin prevailed. A plan from
this master mind provided for what was called a “General
Government,” administered by a “President-General
and Grand Council,” where each Colony should have
representatives in proportion to its contributions,&mdash;Massachusetts
and Virginia having seven each, while
New York had only four; and the first meeting of
the “General Government” was to be at Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Local jealousy and pretension were then too strong for
such a Union: and it found no greater favor in England;
for there Union was “dreaded as the keystone of
Independence.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In defending this plan, Franklin, who
had not yet entered into the idea of Independence, did
not hesitate to say that he looked upon the Colonies “as
so many counties gained to Great Britain,”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;employing
an illustration which most forcibly suggested actual
Unity. Though this experiment failed, it revealed the
longing for one Cisatlantic government, and showed
how under other auspices it might be accomplished.</p>

<p>Little more than ten years elapsed before the same
yearning for common life appeared again in the Colonial
Congress at New York, convened in 1765, on the
recommendation of Massachusetts, to arrest the tyranny
of the Stamp Act and assaults upon the common liberties.
Nine Colonies, after deliberation, united in a
Declaration of Rights common to all. Here was the
inspiration of James Otis, the youthful orator of Freedom,
whose tongue of flame had already flashed the cry,
“Taxation without representation is tyranny,” and that
other cry, worthy of perpetual memory, “Equality and
the power of the whole, without distinction of color.”
These were voices that heralded our Nation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mother country persisted; and in the same proportion
the Colonies were aroused to the necessity of
union. Meanwhile that inflexible Republican, Samuel
Adams, of Massachusetts, brooding on the perils to Liberty,
conceived the idea of what he called “a Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of American States,” out of whose deliberations should
come what he boldly proclaimed “an American Commonwealth,”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;not
several commonwealths, not Thirteen,
but One. Here, in a single brilliant flash, was
revealed the image of National Unity, while the word
“Commonwealth” denoted the common weal which all
should share. The declared object of this burning patriot
was “to answer the great purpose of preserving
our liberties,”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;meaning, of course, the liberties of all.
Better words could not be chosen to describe a republican
government. This was in 1773. Every Colony,
catching the echo, stirred with national life. Delegates
were appointed, and in 1774 a Congress called “Continental,”
with a representation from twelve Colonies, was
organized at Philadelphia, and undertook to speak in
the name of “the good people” of the Colonies. Here
was a national act. In the Declaration of Rights which
it put forth,&mdash;fit precursor of the Declaration of Independence,&mdash;it
grandly claims, that, by the immutable
laws of Nature, the principles of the English Constitution,
and the several Charters, all the inhabitants are
“entitled to life, liberty, and property,” and then announces
“that the foundation of English liberty and
of all free government is <i>a right in the people to participate
in their legislative council</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Here was a claim
of popular rights as a first principle of government.
Proceeding from a Congress of all, such a claim marks
yet another stage of national life.</p>

<p>The next year witnessed a second Continental Congress,
also at Philadelphia, which entered upon a mightier
career. Proceeding at once to exercise national powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
this great Congress undertook to put the Colonies
in a state of defence, authorized the raising of troops,
framed rules for the government of the army, commenced
the equipment of armed vessels, and commissioned
George Washington as “general and commander-in-chief
of the army of the United Colonies, and of all
the forces now raised or to be raised by them, and of
all others who shall voluntarily offer their service and
join the said army, for the defence of American liberty.”
Here were national acts, which history cannot forget,
and their object was nothing less than American liberty.
It was American liberty which Washington was
commissioned to defend. Under these inspirations was
our Nation born. The time had now come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Independence was declared. Here was an act which,
from beginning to end, in every particular and all its
inspirations, was National, stamping upon the whole
people Unity in the support of Human Rights. It was
done “in the name and by authority of the good people
of these Colonies,” called at the beginning “one people,”
and it was entitled “Declaration by the Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled,”
without a word of separate sovereignty. As a
National act it has two distinct features: first, a severance
of the relations between the “United Colonies”
and the mother country; and, secondly, a declaration of
self-evident truths on which the severance was justified
and the new Nation founded. It is the “United Colonies”
that are declared free and independent States;
and this act is justified by the sublime declaration that
all men are created equal, with certain inalienable rights,
and that to secure these rights governments are instituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed. Here was that “American
Commonwealth,” the image of National Unity, dedicated
to Human Rights, which had enchanted the vision of
the early patriot seeking new safeguards for Liberty.
Here was a new Nation, with new promises and covenants,
never before made. The constituent authority
was “the People.” The rights it promised and covenanted
were the Equal Rights of All; not the rights
of Englishmen, but the rights of Man. On this account
our Declaration has its great meaning in history; on
this account our nation became at once a source of
light to the world. Well might the sun have stood
still on that day to witness a kindred luminary ascending
into the sky!</p>

<p>In this sudden transformation where was the sovereignty?
It was declared that the <i>United</i> Colonies
are and <i>of right</i> ought to be free and independent
States. It was never declared that the <i>separate</i> Colonies
were so <i>of right</i>. Plainly they never were so <i>in
fact</i>. Therefore there was no separate sovereignty either
of right or in fact. The sovereignty anterior to Independence
was in the mother country; afterwards it was
in the people of the United States, who took the place
of the mother country. As the original sovereignty was
undivided, so also was that sovereignty of the people
which became its substitute. If authority were needed
for this irresistible conclusion, I might find it in the
work of the great commentator, Mr. Justice Story, and
in that powerful discourse of John Quincy Adams entitled
“The Jubilee of the Constitution,” in both of
which the sovereignty is accorded to the People, and
not to the States. Nor should I forget that rarest political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
genius, Alexander Hamilton, who, regarding these
things as a contemporary, declared most triumphantly
that “the Union had complete sovereignty”; that “the
Declaration of Independence was the fundamental constitution
of every State”; and, finally, that “the union
and independence of these States are blended and incorporated
in one and the same act.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Such was the
great beginning of national life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A beautiful meditative poet, whose words are often
most instructive, confesses that we may reach heights
we cannot hold:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>Our nation found it so. Only a few days after the
great Declaration in the name of “the People,” Articles
of Confederation were brought forward in the name of
“the States.” Evidently these were drawn before the
Declaration, and they were in the handwriting of John
Dickinson, then a delegate from Pennsylvania, whom
the eldest Adams calls “the bell-wether of the aristocratical
flock,”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and who had been the orator against
the Declaration. Not unnaturally, an opponent of the
Declaration favored a system which forgot the constituent
sovereignty of the people, and made haste to establish
the pretensions of States. These Articles were not
readily adopted. There was hesitation in Congress, and
then hesitation among the States. At last, on the 1st
of March, 1781, Maryland gave a tardy adhesion, and
this shadow of a government began. It was a pitiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
sight. The Declaration was sacrificed. Instead of “one
people,” we were nothing but “a league” of States; and
our nation, instead of drawing its quickening life from
“the good people,” drew it from a combination of “artificial
bodies”; instead of recognizing the constituent
sovereignty of the people, by whose voice Independence
was declared, it recognized only the pretended
sovereignty of States; and, to complete the humiliating
transformation, the national name was called “the
style,” being a term which denotes sometimes title and
sometimes copartnership, instead of unchangeable unity.
Such an apostasy could not succeed.</p>

<p>Even before the adoption of this denationalizing
framework, its failure had begun. The Confederation
became at once a byword and a sorrow. It was not
fit for war or peace. It accomplished nothing national.
It arrested all the national activities. Each
State played the part of the feudal chieftain, selfishly
absorbing power and denying it to the Nation. Money
could not be collected even for national purposes. Commerce
could not be regulated. Justice could not be
administered. Rights could not be assured. Congress
was without coercive power, and could act only through
the local sovereignty. National unity was impossible,
and in its stead was a many-headed pretension. The
country was lapsing into chaos.</p>

<p>From Boston, which was the early home of the Revolution,
had already proceeded a cry for Nationality. A
convention of delegates from Massachusetts, Connecticut,
and New Hampshire, with Thomas Cushing as
President, assembled at Boston in August, 1780, where,
among other things, it was recommended “that the
Union of these States be fixed in a more solid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
permanent manner, that the powers of Congress be more
clearly ascertained and defined, and that the important
<i>national</i> concerns of the United States be <i>under the
superintendency and direction of one supreme head</i>,” and
the word <i>Nation</i> is adopted as the natural expression
for our unity.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But the time had not yet come for
this fulfilment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the prevailing darkness, two voices made themselves
heard, both speaking for National Unity on the
foundation of Human Rights. The singular accord between
the two, not only in sentiment, but also in language,
and in date of utterance, attests concert. One
voice was that of Congress, in an Address and Recommendations
to the States on the close of the war, bearing
date 18th April, 1783, where, urging “effectual provision”
for the war debts, as demanded alike by national
honor, and the honor of the cause in which they had
been contracted, it was said, in words worthy of companionship
with the immortal Declaration: “Let it be
remembered that it has ever been the pride and boast
of America that <i>the rights for which she contended were
the rights of Human Nature</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The other voice was
that of Washington, in a general order, also bearing
date 18th April, 1783, announcing the close of the war,
where, after declaring his “rapture” in the prospect before
the country, he says: “Happy, thrice happy, shall
they be pronounced hereafter who have contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
anything, who have performed the meanest office, in
erecting this stupendous fabric of Freedom and Empire
on the broad basis of Independency, <i>who have assisted
in protecting the rights of Human Nature</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This appeal
was followed by a circular letter to the Governors,
where, after announcing that it is for the United States
to determine “whether they will be respectable and
prosperous or contemptible and miserable <i>as a Nation</i>,”
Washington proceeds to name first among the things
essential to national well-being, if not even to national
existence, what he calls “an indissoluble union of the
States under one federal head”; and he adds, that
there must be a forgetfulness of “local prejudices and
policies,” and that “Liberty” must be at the foundation
of the whole structure.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Soon afterwards appearing before
Congress to surrender the trust committed to him
as commander-in-chief, he hailed the United States as a
“Nation,” and “our dearest country,”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>&mdash;thus embracing
the whole in his heart, as for seven years he had
defended the whole by his prudence and valor.</p>

<p>An incident of a different character attested the consciousness
of National Unity. The vast outlying territory,
unsettled at the beginning of the war, and wrested
from the British crown by the common blood and treasure,
was claimed as a common property, subject to the
disposition of Congress for the general good. One by
one, the States yielded their individual claims. The
cession of Virginia comprehended all that grand region
northwest of the Ohio, fertile and rich beyond imagination,
where are now prosperous States rejoicing in the
Union. All these cessions were on the condition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the lands should “be disposed of for the common benefit
of the United States, and be settled and formed into
distinct <i>republican States</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Here was a National act,
with the promise of republican government, which was
the forerunner of the guaranty of a republican government
in the National Constitution.</p>

<p>The best men, in their longing for national unity, all
concurred in the necessity of immediate action to save
the country. Foremost in time, as in genius, was Alexander
Hamilton, who was prompt to insist that Congress
should have “complete sovereignty, except as to
that part of internal police which relates to the rights
of property and life among individuals and to raising
money by internal taxes”; and still further, in words
which harmonized with the Declaration of Independence,
that “the fabric of the American empire ought to
rest on the solid basis of the consent of the people.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
In kindred spirit, Schuyler announced “the necessity
of <i>a supreme and coercive power</i> in the government of
these States.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Hamilton and Schuyler were both of
New York, which, with such representatives, took the
lead in solemn resolutions, which, after declaring that
“the situation of these States is in a peculiar manner
critical,” and that “the present system exposes the common
cause to a precarious issue,” concluded with a call
for “a general convention of the States, specially authorized
to revise and amend the Confederation.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
movement ended in the National Convention. Other
States followed, and Congress recommended it as “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
most probable means of establishing in these States a
firm National Government.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Meantime, Noah Webster,
whom you know so well as author of the popular
Dictionary, in an essay on the situation, published at
the time, proposed a new system of government, which
should act directly on the individual citizens, and by
which Congress should be invested with full powers of
legislation within its sphere, and for carrying its laws
into effect.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But this proposition involved nothing less
than a National Government with supreme powers, to
which the States should be subordinate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I mention three illustrious characters, who at
this time lent the weight of their great names to the
national cause,&mdash;Jay, Madison, and Washington,&mdash;each
in his way without a peer. I content myself with a few
words from each. John Jay, writing to John Adams,
at the time our minister in London, under date of 4th
May, 1786, says: “One of the first wishes of my heart”
is “to see the people of America become <i>One Nation in
every respect</i>; for, as to the separate Legislatures, I would
have them considered, with relation to the Confederacy,
<i>in the same light in which counties stand</i> to the State of
which they are parts, viz., merely as districts to facilitate
the purposes of domestic order and good government.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Even in this strong view Jay was not alone.
Franklin had already led in likening the colonies to “so
many counties.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Madison’s desires were differently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
expressed. After declaring against “an individual independence
of the States,” on the one side, and “a
consolidation of the States into one simple republic,”
on the other side, he sought what he called a “middle
ground,” which, if varying from that of Jay, was
essentially national. He would have “<i>a due supremacy
of the National authority</i>, and leave in force the local
authorities so far as they can be subordinately useful.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Here is the definition of a Nation. Washington, in a
letter to Jay, dated 1st August, 1786, stated the whole
case with his accustomed authority. Insisting upon the
importance of “a coercive power,” he pleads for national
life: “I do not conceive we can exist long as <i>a Nation</i>
without having lodged somewhere a power which will
pervade the whole Union in <i>as energetic a manner as
the authority of the State governments extends over the
several States</i>.” He then adds: “To be fearful of investing
Congress, constituted as that body is, with <i>ample
authorities for National purposes</i>, appears to me the
very climax of popular absurdity and madness.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Such
were the longings of patriots, all filled with a passion
for country. But Washington went still further, when,
on another occasion, he denounced State sovereignty as
“bantling,” and even “monster.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Constituent Convention, often called Federal, better
called National, assembled at Philadelphia in May,
1787. It was a memorable body, whose deliberations
have made an epoch in the history of government. Jefferson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and John Adams were at the time abroad in the
foreign service of the country, Samuel Adams was in
service at home in Massachusetts, and Jay in New
York; but Washington, Franklin, Hamilton, Madison,
Gouverneur Morris, George Mason, Wilson, Ellsworth,
and Sherman appeared among its members. Washington,
by their unanimous voice, became President; and,
according to the rules of the Convention, on adjournment,
every member stood in his place until the President
had passed him. Here is a glimpse of that august
body which Art may yet picture. Who would not be
glad to look upon Franklin, Hamilton, and Madison
standing in their places while Washington passed?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the first day after the adoption of the rules, Edmund
Randolph, of Virginia, opened the great business.
He began by announcing that the “Confederation” produced
no security against foreign invasion; that the
“Federal Government” could not suppress quarrels or
rebellion; that the “Federal Government” could not
defend itself against encroachments from the States;
and then, insisting that the remedy must be found in
“the republican principle,” concluded with a series of
propositions for a National Government, with a “National”
Legislature in two branches, a “National” Executive,
and a “National” Judiciary, the whole crowned
by the guaranty of a republican government in each
State. This series of propositions was followed the next
day by a simple statement in the form of a resolution,
where, after setting forth the insufficiency of “a union
of the States merely Federal,” or of “treaties among the
States as individual sovereignties,” it was declared “that
<i>a National Government ought to be established</i>, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of a supreme legislative, executive, and judiciary.” Better
words could not have been chosen to express the
prevailing aspiration for national life. After ample debate,
the resolution in this form was adopted. At a
later stage, in seeming deference to mistaken sensibilities,
the word “National” gave place to the term
“the government of the United States”; but this term
equally denoted National Unity, although it did not use
the words. The whole clause afterwards found a noble
substitute in the Preamble to the Constitution, which is
the annunciation of a National Government proceeding
directly from the People, like the Declaration of Independence
itself.</p>

<p>From the beginning to the end of its debates, the Convention
breathed the same patriotic fervor. Amidst all
difference in details, and above the persistent and sinister
contest for the equal representation of the States,
great and small, the sentiment of Unity found constant
utterance. I have already mentioned Madison and
Hamilton, who wished a National Government; but
others were not less decided. Gouverneur Morris began
early by explaining the difference between “Federal”
and “National.” The former implied “a mere
compact, resting on the good faith of the parties”;
the latter had “a complete and compulsive operation.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Constantly this impassioned statesman protested against
State pretensions, insisting that the States were originally
“nothing more than colonial corporations,”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and
exclaiming, “We cannot annihilate, but we may perhaps
take out the teeth of the serpents.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Wilson
was a different character,&mdash;gentle by nature, but informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
by studies in jurisprudence and by the education
brought from his Scottish home. He was for a
National Government, and did not think it inconsistent
with the “lesser jurisdictions” of States, which he would
preserve;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> he would not “extinguish these planets,” but
keep them “within their proper orbits for subordinate
purposes.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He was too much of a jurist to admit,
“that, when the Colonies became independent of Great
Britain, they became independent also of each other,”
and he insisted that they became independent, “not
individually, but unitedly.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts,
was as strong on this point as Gouverneur
Morris, insisting that “we never were independent
States, were not such now, and never could be, even
on the principles of the Confederation.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Rufus King,
also of Massachusetts, touched a higher key, when he
wished that “every man in America” should be “secured
in all his rights,” and that these should not
be “sacrificed to the phantom of State sovereignty.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Good words, worthy of him who in the Continental
Congress moved the prohibition of Slavery in the national
territories.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> And Charles Pinckney, of South
Carolina, said, in other words of precious significance,
that “every freeman has a right to <i>the same protection
and security</i>,” and then again, that “equality is the
leading feature of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Under such
influences the Constitution was adopted by the Convention.</p>

<p>It is needless to dwell on its features, all so well
known; but there are certain points not to be disregarded
now. There is especially the beginning. Next
after the opening words of the Declaration of Independence,
the opening words of the Constitution are
the grandest in history. They sound like a majestic
overture, fit prelude to the transcendent harmonies of
National life on a theatre of unexampled proportions.
Though familiar, they cannot be too often repeated; for
they are in themselves an assurance of popular rights
and an epitome of National duties: “<i>We, the people of
the United States</i>, in order to form a more perfect Union,
establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide
for the common defence, promote the general welfare,
and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for
the United States of America.” Thus by the people
of the United States was the Constitution ordained and
established; not by the States, nor even by the people
of the several States, but by <i>the people of the United
States</i> in aggregate individuality. Nor is it a league,
alliance, agreement, compact, or confederation; but it
is a Constitution, which in itself denotes an indivisible
unity under one supreme law, permanent in character;
and this Constitution, thus ordained and established,
has for its declared purposes nothing less than liberty,
justice, domestic tranquillity, the common defence, the
general welfare, and a more perfect union, all essentially
National, and to be maintained by the National
arm. The work thus begun was completed by three further
provisions: first, the lofty requirement that “the
United States shall guaranty to every State in this
Union a republican form of government,”&mdash;thus subjecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the States to the presiding judgment of the
Nation, which is left to determine the definition of a
republican government; secondly, the practical investiture
of Congress with authority “to make all laws
which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
execution all the powers vested by this Constitution in
the Government of the United States, or in any department
or officer thereof,”&mdash;thus assuring the maintenance
of the National Government, and the execution
of its powers through a faithful Congress chosen by the
people; and, thirdly, the imperial declaration, that “this
Constitution, and the laws of the United States which
shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties
made or which shall be made under the authority of
the United States, shall be <i>the supreme law of the land</i>,
and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby,
<i>anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the
contrary notwithstanding</i>,”&mdash;thus forever fixing the supremacy
of the National Government on a pinnacle
above all local laws and constitutions. And thus did
our country again assume the character and obligations
of a Nation. Its first awakening was in the Declaration
of Independence; its second was in the National
Constitution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On its adoption, the Constitution was transmitted to
Congress with a letter from Washington, where, among
other things, it is said that “in all our deliberations
we kept steadily in our view that which appears to us
the greatest interest of every true American, <i>the consolidation
of our Union</i>, in which is involved our prosperity,
felicity, safety, perhaps our National existence.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Enough that this letter is signed “George Washington”;
but it was not merely the expression of his individual
sentiments. It was unanimously adopted by the Convention,
on the report of the committee that made the
final draught of the Constitution itself, so that it must
be considered as belonging to this great transaction. By
its light the Constitution must be read. If anybody is
disposed to set up the denationalizing pretensions of
States under the National Constitution, let him bear in
mind this explicit declaration, that, throughout all the
deliberations of the Convention, the one object kept
steadily in view was <i>the consolidation of our Union</i>.
Such is the unanimous testimony of the Convention,
authenticated by George Washington.</p>

<p>The Constitution was discussed next in the States.
It was vindicated as creating a National Government,
and it was opposed also on this very ground. Thus
from opposite quarters comes the concurring testimony.
In Connecticut, Mr. Johnson, who had been chairman
of the committee that reported the final draught, said,
in reply to inquiries of his constituents, that the Convention
had “gone upon entirely new ground: they
have formed <i>one new Nation</i> out of the individual
States.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> George Mason, of Virginia, proclaimed at
home that “the Confederation of the States was entirely
changed into <i>one consolidated government</i>,”&mdash;that
it was “a <i>National</i> government, and no longer a Confederation.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Patrick Henry, in his vigorous opposition,
testified to the completeness with which the work
had been accomplished. Inquiring by what authority
the Convention assumed to make such a government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
he exclaimed: “That this is a consolidated government
is demonstrably clear.… Give me leave to demand,
What right had they to say, <i>We, the people</i>?… Who
authorized them to speak the language of <i>We, the people</i>,
instead of <i>We, the States</i>?… If the States be not
the agents of this compact, it must be one great consolidated
National government of the people of all the
States.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Then again the same fervid orator declared,
with infinite point, “The question turns, Sir, on that
poor little thing, the expression, <i>We, the people</i>, instead
of <i>the States</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Patrick Henry was right. The question
did turn on that grand expression, <i>We, the people</i>,
in the very frontispiece of the Constitution, filling the
whole with life-giving power; and so long as it stands
there, the denationalizing pretensions of States must
shrink into littleness. Originally “one people” during
colonial days, we have been unalterably fixed in this
condition by two National acts: first, the Declaration
of Independence, and then again, the National Constitution.
Thus is doubly assured the original unity in
which we were born.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Other tokens of Nationality, like the air we breathe,
are so common that they hardly attract attention; but
each has a character of its own. They belong to the
“unities” of our nation.</p>

<p>1. There is the National Flag. He must be cold
indeed, who can look upon its folds rippling in the
breeze without pride of country. If in a foreign land
the flag is companionship, and country itself, with all
its endearments, who, as he sees it, can think of a State
merely? Whose eyes, once fastened upon its radiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
trophies, can fail to recognize the image of the whole
Nation? It has been called “a floating piece of poetry”;
and yet I know not if it have an intrinsic beauty beyond
other ensigns. Its highest beauty is in what it
symbolizes. It is because it represents all, that all gaze
at it with delight and reverence. It is a piece of bunting
lifted in the air; but it speaks sublimely, and every
part has a voice. Its stripes of alternate red and white
proclaim the original <i>union</i> of thirteen States to maintain
the Declaration of Independence. Its stars of white
on a field of blue proclaim that <i>union</i> of States constituting
our national constellation, which receives a new
star with every new State. The two together signify
Union, past and present. The very colors have a language,
officially recognized by our fathers. White is
for purity; red, for valor; blue, for justice. And all
together, bunting, stripes, stars, and colors, blazing in
the sky, make the flag of our country, to be cherished
by all our hearts, to be upheld by all our hands.</p>

<p>Not at once did this ensign come into being. Its
first beginning was in the camp before Boston, and it
was announced by Washington in these words: “The
day which gave being to the new army, we hoisted the
<i>Union flag</i>, in compliment to the United Colonies.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
The National forces and the National flag began together.
Shortly afterwards, amidst the acclamations of
the people, a fleet of five sail left Philadelphia, according
to the language of the time, “under the display of
a <i>Union flag</i> with thirteen stripes.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This was probably
the same flag, not yet matured into its present
form. In its corner, where are now the stars, were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
crosses of St. George and St. Andrew, red and white,
originally representing England and Scotland, and when
conjoined, after the union of those two countries, known
as “the Union.” To these were added thirteen stripes,
alternate red and white, and the whole was hailed at
the time as the Great Union Flag. The States, represented
by the stripes, were in subordination to the National
Unity, represented by the two crosses. But this
form did not continue long. By a resolution adopted
14th June, 1777, and made public 3d September, 1777,
Congress determined “that the flag of the thirteen United
States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that
<i>the union</i> be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing
a new constellation.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Here the crosses of St.
George and St. Andrew gave place to white stars in a
blue field; the familiar symbol of British union gave
place to another symbol of union peculiar to ourselves;
and this completed the national flag, which a little later
floated at the surrender of Burgoyne. Long afterward,
in 1818, it was provided by Congress that a star be
added on the admission of a new State, “to take effect
on the fourth day of July next succeeding such admission.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Thus, in every respect, and at each stage of its
history, the National Flag testifies to the National Unity.
The whole outstretched, indivisible country is seated in
its folds.</p>

<p>There is a curious episode of the national flag, which
is not without value. As far back as 1754, Franklin,
while attempting a union of the Colonies, pictured the
principal ones in a wood-cut under the device of a
snake divided into eight parts marked with their initials,
and under the disjointed whole the admonitory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
motto, “<i>Join or die</i>,”&mdash;thus indicating the paramount
necessity of Union. In the heats of the Revolutionary
discussion, a similar representation of all the Thirteen
Colonies was adopted as the head-piece of newspapers,
and was painted on banners; but when the Union was
accomplished, the divisions and initials were dropped,
and the snake was exhibited whole, coiled in conscious
power, with thirteen rattles, and under it another admonitory
motto, “<i>Don’t tread on me</i>,”&mdash;being a warning
to the mother country.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> This flag was yellow, and it
became the early standard of the Revolutionary navy,
being for the first time hoisted by Paul Jones with his
own hands. It had a further lesson. A half-formed additional
rattle was said by Franklin “to represent the
province of Canada,” and the wise man added, that “the
rattles are united together so as never to be separated
but by breaking them to pieces.” Thus the snake at
one time pictured the necessity of Union, and at another
time its indissoluble bond.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But these symbols
were all in harmony with the national flag, which, from
its first appearance, in all its forms, pictured the common
cause.</p>

<p>2. There is next the National Motto, as it appears
on the national seal and on the national money. A
common seal and common money are signs of National
Unity. In each the supreme sovereignty of the Nation
is manifest. The first is like the national flag, and
stands for the Nation, especially in treaties with foreign
powers. The second is a national convenience, if not necessity,
taking its distinctive character from the Nation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
so that everywhere it is a representative of the Nation.
Each has the same familiar motto, <i>E pluribus unum</i>,&mdash;“From
many one.” Its history attests its significance.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1776, the very day of Independence,
Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas
Jefferson were appointed a committee to prepare a device
for a great seal. They were of the identical committee
that had reported the Declaration of Independence
itself. Their report on the seal was made 20th
August, 1776; and here we first meet the national
motto, in such entire harmony with the Declaration,
making us “one people.” Questions of detail intervened,
and no conclusion was reached until 20th June,
1782, when the present seal was adopted, being the
American bald eagle, with the olive-branch in one talon
and a bundle of thirteen arrows in the other, and in his
beak a scroll, bearing the inscription, <i>E pluribus unum</i>.
Familiar as these Latin words have become,&mdash;so that
they haunt the memory of manhood, youth, and childhood
alike,&mdash;it is not always considered how completely
and simply they tell the story of our national
life. Out of Many Colonies was formed One Nation.
Former differences were merged in this unity. No
longer Many, they were One. The Nation by its
chosen motto repeats perpetually, “We are One”; and
the Constitution echoes back, “We, the people of the
United States.”</p>

<p>3. There is next the National Name, which of itself
implies National Unity. The States are not merely
allied, associated, coalesced, confederated, but they are
<i>United</i>, and the Constitution, formed to secure a more
perfect union, is “for the <i>United</i> States of America,”
which term was used as the common name of the
Nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>A regret has been sometimes expressed by patriots
and by poets, that some single term was not originally
adopted, which of itself should exclude every denationalizing
pretension, and be a talisman for the heart to
cherish and for the tongue to utter,&mdash;as when Nelson
gave his great watchword at Trafalgar, “<i>England</i> expects
every man to do his duty.” Occasionally it is
proposed to call the country <i>Columbia</i>, and thus restore
to the great discoverer at least part of the honor taken
from him when the continent was misnamed <i>America</i>.
<i>Alleghania</i> has also been proposed; but this word is
too obviously a mere invention, besides its unwelcome
suggestion of Alligator. Another proposition has been
<i>Vinland</i>, being the name originally given by the Northmen,
four centuries before Christopher Columbus. Professor
Lieber, on one occasion, called the nation <i>Freeland</i>,
a name to which it will soon be entitled. Even
as a bond of union, such a name would not be without
value. As long ago as Herodotus, it was said of a certain
people,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> that they would have been the most powerful
in the world, if they had been united; but this was
impossible, from the want among themselves of a common
name.</p>

<p>Forgetting that the actual name implies Unity, and,
when we consider its place in the preamble of the National
Constitution, that it implies Nationality also, the
partisans of State pretensions argue from it against even
the idea of country; and here I have a curious and
authentic illustration. In reply to an inquirer,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> who
wished a single name, Mr. Calhoun exclaimed: “Not at
all; we have no name because we ought to have none;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
we are only States united, and have no country.” Alas,
if it be so!&mdash;if this well-loved land, for which so many
have lived, for which so many have died, is not our
country! But this strange utterance shows how completely
the poison of these pretensions had destroyed
the common sense, as well as the patriotism, of this
much-mistaken man.</p>

<p>Names may be given by sovereign power to new
discoveries or settlements; but, as a general rule, they
grow out of the soil, they are autochthonous. Even
Augustus, when ruling the Roman world, confessed that
he could not make a new word,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and Plato tells us that
“a creator of names is the rarest of human creatures.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Reflecting on these things, we may appreciate something
of the difficulty in the way of a new name at
the formation of the National Constitution. As this
was little more than a transcript of prevailing ideas
and institutions, it was natural to take the name used
in the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>And yet it must not be forgotten that there was
a name of different character which was much employed.
Congress was called “Continental,” the army
“Continental,” the money “Continental,”&mdash;a term certainly
of unity, as well as vastness. But there was
still another national designation, accepted at home
and abroad. Our country was called “America,” and
we were called “Americans.” Here was a natural, unsought,
and instinctive name,&mdash;a growth, and not a
creation,&mdash;implying national unity and predominance,
if not exclusive power, on the continent. It was used
not occasionally or casually, but constantly,&mdash;not merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in newspapers, but in official documents. Not an address
of Congress, not a military order, not a speech,
which does not contain this term, at once so expansive
and so unifying. At the opening of the first Continental
Congress, Patrick Henry, in a different mood from
that of a later day, announced the national unity under
this very name. Declaring the boundaries of the several
Colonies effaced, and the distinctions between Virginians,
Pennsylvanians, New-Yorkers, and New-Englanders
as no more, he exclaimed, in words of comprehensive
patriotism, “I am not a Virginian, but an <i>American</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Congress took up the strain, and commissioned
Washington as commander-in-chief of the armies “for
the defence of <i>American</i> liberty”;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and Washington
himself, in his first general order at Cambridge, assuming
his great command, announced that the armies were
“for the support and defence of the liberties of <i>America</i>;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and in a letter to Congress, just before the Battle
of Trenton, he declared that he had labored “to discourage
all kinds of local attachments and distinctions of
country, <i>denominating the whole by the greater name of
American</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Then at the close of the war, in its immortal
Address, fit supplement to the Declaration of
Independence, Congress said: “Let it be remembered
that it has ever been the pride and boast of <i>America</i>
that the rights for which she contended were the rights
of Human Nature.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Washington again, in his letter to
Congress communicating the National Constitution, says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
in other words, which, like those of Congress, cannot be
too often quoted, that “the <i>consolidation of our Union</i>”
is “the greatest interest of <i>every true American</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Afterwards,
in his Farewell Address, which from beginning
to end is one persuasive appeal for nationality, after
enjoining upon his fellow-citizens that “<i>unity of government</i>
which constitutes them <i>one people</i>,” he gives to
them a national name, and this was his legacy: “<i>The
name of American, which belongs to you in your national
capacity</i>, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism
more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Thus did Washington put aside those baneful
pretensions under which the country has suffered,
even to the extent of adopting a National Name, which,
like the Union itself, should have a solid coercive
power.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that in the lapse of time history
will vindicate the name adopted by Washington,
which may grow with the Republic, until it becomes
the natural designation of one country. Our fathers
used this term more wisely than they knew; but they
acted under Providential guidance. Is it not said of
the stars, that God “calleth them all by names, by the
greatness of His might”?<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Is it not declared also that
He will make him who overcometh a pillar in the temple,
and give to him a “new name”?<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> So, as our stars
multiply, and the nation overcometh its adversaries, persuading
all to its declared principles, everywhere on the
continent, it will become a pillar in the temple, and the
name of the continent itself will be needed to declare
alike its unity and its power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>4. To these “unities,” derived from history and the
heart of the people, may be added another, where Nature
is the great teacher. I refer to the geographical position
and configuration of our country, if not of the whole
continent, marking it for one nation. Unity is written
upon it by the Almighty hand. In this respect it differs
much from Europe, where, for generations, seas,
rivers, and mountains kept people apart, who had else,
“like kindred drops, been mingled into one.” There is
no reason why they should not commingle here. Nature
in every form is propitious. Facility of intercourse,
not less than common advantage, leads to unity:
both these are ours. Here are navigable rivers, numerous
and famous, being so many highways of travel, and
a chain of lakes, each an inland sea. Then there is an
unexampled extent of country adapted to railways; and
do not forget that with the railway is the telegraph,
using the lightning as its messenger, so that the interrogatory
to Job is answered, “Canst thou send lightnings
that they may go?”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The country is one open
expanse, from the frozen Arctic to the warm waters of
the Gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains,&mdash;and
there already science supplies the means of
overcoming this barrier, which in other days would have
marked international boundaries. The Pacific Railway
will neutralize these mountains, and complete the geographical
unity of the continent. The slender wire of
the telegraph, when once extended, is an indissoluble
tie; the railway is an iron band. But these depend
upon opportunities which Nature supplies, so that Nature
herself is one of the guardians of our nation.</p>

<p>He has studied history poorly, and human nature no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
better, who imagines that this broad compacted country
can be parcelled into different nationalities. Where
will you run the thread of partition? By what river?
Along what mountain? On what line of latitude or
longitude? Impossible. No line of longitude or latitude,
no mountain, no river, can become the demarcation.
Every State has rights in every other State. The
whole country has a title, which it will never renounce,
in every part, whether the voluminous Mississippi as
it pours to the sea, or that same sea as it chafes upon
our coast. As well might we of the East attempt to
shut you of the West from the ocean as you attempt
to shut us from the Mississippi. The ocean will always
be yours as it is ours, and the Mississippi will always
be ours as it is yours.</p>

<p>Our country was planned by Providence for a united
and homogeneous people. Apparent differences harmonize.
Even climate, passing through all gradations from
North to South, is so tempered as to present an easy
uniformity from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.
Unmeasured supplies of all kinds, mineral and agricultural,
are at hand,&mdash;the richest ores and the most golden
crops, with the largest coal-fields of the world below
and the largest corn-fields of the world above. Strabo
said of ancient Gaul, that, by its structure, with its vast
plains and considerable rivers, it was destined to become
the theatre of a great civilization.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But the structure
of our country is more auspicious. Our plains are
vaster and our rivers more considerable, furnishing a
theatre grander than any imagined by the Greek geographer.
It is this theatre, thus appointed by Nature,
which is now open for the good of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Here I stop, to review the field over which we have
passed, and to gather its harvest into one sheaf. Beginning
with the infancy of the Colonies, we have seen
how, with different names and governments, they were
all under <i>one sovereignty</i>, with common and interchangeable
rights of citizenship, so that no British subject in
one Colony could be made an alien in any other Colony;
how, even at the beginning, longings for a common
life began, showing themselves in “loving accord”; how
Franklin regarded the Colonies “as so many counties”;
how the longings increased, until, under the pressure
of the mother country, they broke forth in aspiration
for “an American Commonwealth”; how they were at
last organized in a Congress, called, from its comprehensive
character, “Continental”; how, in the exercise
of powers derived from “the good people,” and in their
name, the Continental Congress put forth the Declaration
of Independence, by which the sovereignty of the
mother country was forever renounced, and we were
made “one people,” solemnly dedicated to Human
Rights, and thus became a Nation; how the undivided
sovereignty of all was substituted for the undivided
sovereignty of the mother country, embracing all the
States as the other sovereignty had embraced all the
Colonies; how, according to Franklin, the States were
locked together, “so as never to be separated, but by
breaking them to pieces”; how in an evil hour the Confederation
was formed in deference to denationalizing
pretensions of the States; how the longings for national
life continued, and found utterance in Congress, in
Washington, and in patriot compeers; how Jay wished
the States should be like “counties”; how “Washington
denounced State sovereignty as “bantling” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
“monster”; how at last a National Convention assembled,
with Washington as President, where it was voted
that “a National Government ought to be established”;
how in this spirit, after ample debate, the National
Constitution was formed, with its preamble beginning
“We, the people,” with its guaranty of a republican
government to all the States, with its investiture of
Congress with all needful powers for the maintenance
of the Government, and with its assertion of supremacy
over State constitutions and laws; how this Constitution
was commended by Washington in the name
of the Convention as “the consolidation of our Union”;
how it was vindicated and opposed as creating a National
Government; how on its adoption we again
became a Nation; then how our nationality has been
symbolized in the National Flag, the National Motto,
and the National Name; and, lastly, how Nature, in the
geographical position and configuration of the country,
has supplied the means of National Unity, and written
her everlasting guaranty. And thus do I bind the
whole together into one conclusion, saying to all, We
are a Nation.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Side by side with the growth of
National Unity was a constant dedication to Human
Rights, which showed itself not only in the Declaration
of Independence, with its promises and covenants,
but in the constant claim of the rights of Magna Charta,
the earlier cries of Otis, the assertion by the first Continental
Congress of the right of the people “to participate
in their legislative council,” the commission of
Washington as commander-in-chief “for the defence of
American liberty,” and the first general order of Washington,
on taking command of his forces, where he rallies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
them to this cause; also in the later proclamation of
Congress, at the close of the Revolution, that the rights
contended for had been “the rights of Human Nature,”
and the farewell general order of Washington, on the
same occasion, where the contest is characterized in the
same way: so that Human Rights were the beginning
and end of the war, while the nation, as it grew into
being, was quickened by these everlasting principles,
and its faith was plighted to their support.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a Nation, with a place in the family of nations,
we have the powers of a nation, with corresponding
responsibilities. Whether we regard these powers as
naturally inhering in the nation, or as conferred upon
it by those two title-deeds, the Declaration of Independence
and the National Constitution, the conclusion
is the same. From Nature, and also from its title-deeds,
our nation must have all needful powers: first,
for the national defence, foremost among which is the
power to uphold and defend the national unity; secondly,
for the safeguard of the citizen in all his rights
of citizenship, foremost among which is equality, the
first of rights, so that, as all owe equal allegiance, all
shall enjoy equal protection; and, thirdly, for the support
and maintenance of all the promises made by the
nation, especially at its birth, being baptismal vows
which cannot be disowned. These three powers are
essentially national. They belong to our nation by the
very law of its being and the terms of its creation.
They cannot be neglected or abandoned. Every person,
no matter what his birth, condition, or color, who
can raise the cry, “I am an American citizen,” has a
right to require at the hands of the nation, that it shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
do its utmost, by all its central powers, to uphold the
national unity, to protect the citizen in the rights of
citizenship, and to perform the original promises of the
nation. Failure here is apostasy and bankruptcy combined.</p>

<p>It is vain to say that these requirements are not
expressly set down in the National Constitution. By
a law existing before this title-deed, they belong to the
essential conditions of national life. If not positively
nominated in the Constitution, they are there in substance;
and this is enough. Every word, from “We,
the people,” to the signature, “George Washington,” is
instinct with national life, and there is not a single
expression taking from the National Government any
inherent power. From this “nothing” in the Constitution
there can come nothing adverse. But there has
always been a positive injunction on the nation to
guaranty “a republican form of government” to all the
States; and who can doubt, that, in the execution of
this guaranty, the nation may exercise all these powers,
and provide especially for the protection of the citizen
in all the rights of citizenship? There are also recent
Amendments, abolishing slavery, and expressly securing
“the privileges and immunities of citizens” against the
pretensions of States. Then there is the Declaration
of Independence itself, which is the earlier title-deed.
By that sacred instrument we were declared “one people,”
with liberty and equality for all, and then, fixing
forever the rights of citizenship, it was announced that
all just government was derived only from “the consent
of the governed.” Come weal or woe, that great
Declaration must stand forever. Other things may fail,
but this cannot fail. It is immortal as the nation itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
It is part of the nation, and the part most worthy of
immortality. By it the National Constitution must be
interpreted; or rather, the two together are the Constitution,&mdash;as
Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights together
are the British Constitution. By the Declaration
our nation was born and its vital principles were
announced; by the Constitution the nation was born
again and supplied with the machinery of government.
The two together are our National Scriptures, each being
a Testament.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Against this conclusion there has been from the beginning
one perpetual pretension in the name of States.
The same spirit which has been so hostile to national
unity in other countries, which made each feudal chief
a petty sovereign, which for a long time convulsed
France, which for centuries divided Italy, and which,
unhappily, still divides Germany, has appeared among
us. Assuming that communities never “sovereign”
while colonies, and independent only by the national
power, had in some way, by some sudden hocus-pocus,
leaped into local sovereignty, and forgetting also that
two sovereignties cannot coexist in the same place, as,
according to the early dramatist,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Two kings in England cannot reign at once,”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the States insisted upon sovereign powers justly belonging
to the Nation. Long ago the duel began. The partisans
of State pretensions, plausibly professing to <i>decentralize</i>
the Government, have done everything possible
to <i>denationalize</i> it. In the name of self-government,
they have organized local lordships hostile to Human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Rights; in the name of the States, they have sacrificed
the Nation.</p>

<p>This pretension, constantly showing itself, has broken
out on three principal occasions. The first was in the
effort of Nullification, which occurred in 1832, where, under
the lead of Mr. Calhoun, South Carolina attempted
to nullify the Revenue Acts of Congress, or, in other
words, to declare them void within her limits. After
encountering the matchless argument of Daniel Webster,
enforced by his best eloquence, Nullification was
blasted by the thunderbolt of Andrew Jackson, who, in
his Proclamation, as President, thus exposed it, even in
the form of Secession, which it assumed at a later day:
“Each State, having expressly parted with so many
powers as to constitute jointly with the other States <i>a
single nation</i>, cannot from that period possess any right
to secede, because such secession does not break a
league, but destroys the unity of a nation.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The pretension
next showed itself in the Rebellion; and now
that the Rebellion is crushed, it reappears in still another
form, by insisting that each State at its own will
may disregard the universal rights of the citizen, and
apply a discrimination according to its own local prejudices,&mdash;thus
within its borders nullifying the primal
truths of the Declaration of Independence. Here again
do State pretensions, in their anarchical egotism, interfere
with the National Unity.</p>

<p>The pretensions of States have found their ablest and
frankest upholder in John C. Calhoun. I take a single
instance, on account of its explicitness. In reply to a
Northern Senator, the defender of Slavery said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now let me tell the Senator that the doctrines which
we advocate are the result of the fullest and most careful
examination of our system of government, and that our conviction
that we constitute <i>an Union, and not a Nation</i>, is as
strong and as sincere as that of the Senator or any other in
the opposite opinion.”</p>

<p>“We are as devoted to the Union as any portion of the
American people (I use the phrase as meaning the people
of the Union); but we see in a national consolidated government
evils innumerable to us. Admit us to be a Nation
and not an Union, and where would we stand? <i>We are in
the minority.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Evidently, in that minority he saw the doom of
Slavery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Local self-government, whether in the town, county,
or State, is of incalculable advantage, supplying the
opportunities of political education, and also a local
administration adapted precisely to local wants. On
this account the system has been admired by travellers
from abroad, who have found in our “town meetings”
the nurseries of the Republic, and have delighted
in local exemption from central supervisorship. De
Tocqueville, who journeyed here, has recorded his authoritative
praise,&mdash;and Laboulaye, who has visited us
only in his remarkable studies, unites with De Tocqueville.
Against that exacting centralization, absorbing
everything, of which Paris is the example, I oppose
the American system of self-government, which leaves
the people to themselves, subject only to the paramount
conditions of national life. But these conditions cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
be sacrificed. No local claim of self-government
can for a moment interfere with the supremacy of the
Nation, in the maintenance of Human Rights.</p>

<p>According to the wisdom of Plutarch, we must shun
those pestilent persons who would “carry trifles to
the highest magistrate,” and, in the same spirit, reject
that pestilent supervisorship which asserts a regulating
power over local affairs, and thus becomes a giant intermeddler.
Let these be decided at home, in the States,
counties, and towns to which they belong. Such is
the genius of our institutions. This is the precious
principle of self-government, which is at once educator
and agency. In the former character, it is an omnipresent
schoolmaster; in the latter, it is a suit of chain-armor,
which, from flexibility, is adapted to the body
of the nation, so that the limbs are free. Each locality
has its own way in matters peculiar to itself. But
the rights of all must be placed under the protection
of all; nor can there be any difference in different
parts of the country. Here the rule must be uniform,
and it must be sustained by the central power radiating
to every part of the various empire. This is according
to the divine Cosmos, which in all its spaces
is pervaded by one universal law. It is the rule of
Almighty Beneficence, which, while leaving human
beings to the activities of daily life and the consciousness
of free-will, subjects all to the same commanding
principles. Such centralization is the highest civilization,
for it approaches the nearest to the heavenly
example. Call it imperialism, if you please: it is simply
the imperialism of the Declaration of Independence,
with all its promises fulfilled. It is rendering unto
Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s. Already by central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
power Slavery has been abolished. Already by
central power all have been assured in the equality of
<i>civil</i> rights.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">“Two truths are told,</div>
<div class="verse">As happy prologues to the swelling act</div>
<div class="verse">Of the imperial theme.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It remains now that by central power all should be
assured in the equality of <i>political</i> rights. This does
not involve necessarily what is sometimes called the
“regulation” of the suffrage by the National Government,
although this would be best. It simply requires
the abolition of any discrimination among citizens, inconsistent
with Equal Rights. If not by Act of Congress,
let it be by a new Amendment of the Constitution;
but it must be at once. Until this is done, we
leave undone what ought to be done, and, in pitiable
failure to perform a national duty, justify the saying
that “there is no health in us.” The preposterous pretension,
that color, whether of the hair or of the skin,
or that any other unchangeable circumstance of natural
condition may be made the “qualification” of a voter,
cannot be tolerated. It is shocking to the moral sense,
and degrading to the understanding.</p>

<p>As in the Nation there can be but one sovereignty,
so there can be but one citizenship. The unity of sovereignty
finds its counterpart and complement in the
unity of citizenship, and the two together are the tokens
of a united people. Thus are the essential conditions
of national life all resolved into three,&mdash;<i>one sovereignty,
one citizenship, one people</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I conclude as I began. The late Rebellion against
the nation was in the name of State Rights; therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
State Rights in their denationalizing pretensions must
be overthrown. It proceeded from hostility to the
sacred principles of the Declaration of Independence;
therefore must these sacred principles be vindicated in
spirit and in letter, so that hereafter they shall be a
supreme law, coëqual with the Constitution, in whose
illumination the Constitution must be read, and they
shall supply the final definition of a Republic for guidance
at home and for example to mankind.</p>

<p>In this great change we follow Nature and obey her
mandate. By irresistible law, water everywhere seeks
its level, and finds it; and so, by law as irresistible, man
seeks the level of every other man in rights, and will
find it. Human passions and human institutions are
unavailing to arrest it, as Nature is stronger than man,
and the Creator is mightier than the creature. The recognition
of this law is essential to the national cause;
for so you will work with Nature rather than against it,
and at the same time in harmony with the Declaration
of Independence. Here I borrow a word from Locke,
who, in his Essay “Of the Conduct of the Understanding,”
says, that, in dealing with propositions, we must
always examine upon what they “bottom.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Now, in
dealing with the Rebellion, we find, that, though in the
name of State Rights, it “bottomed” on opposition to
National Law and open denial of the self-evident truths
declared by our fathers, especially of that central truth
which Abraham Lincoln, at Gettysburg, in the most
touching speech of all history, thus announces: “Four-score
and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
upon this continent a new Nation, conceived in Liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that <i>all men are created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Equal</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Slavery was “bottomed” on the direct
opposite; and so was the Rebellion, from beginning to
end. Therefore we must encounter this denial. We
do not extinguish Slavery, we do not trample out the
Rebellion, until the vital truth declared by our fathers
is established, and Nature in her law is obeyed. To
complete the good work, this is necessary. Liberty is
won: Equality must be won also. In England there
is Liberty without Equality; in France, Equality without
Liberty. The two together must be ours. This
final victory will be the greatest of the war; it will
be the consummation of all other victories. Here must
we plant the national standard. To this championship
I summon you. Go forth, victors in so many
fields, and gather now the highest palm of all. The
victory of ideas is grander far than any victory of
blood. What battle ever did so much for humanity
as the Sermon on Mars Hill? What battle ever did
so much as the Declaration of Independence? But Sermon
and Declaration are one, and it is your glorious
part to assure the National Unity on this adamantine
base.</p>

<p>All hail to the Republic, redeemed and regenerated,
One and Indivisible! Nullification and Secession are
already, like the extinct monsters of a former geological
period, to be seen only in the museum of History.
With their extinction must disappear the captious, litigious,
and disturbing spirit engendered by State pretensions.
The whole face of the country will be transformed.
There will be concord for discord, smiles for
frowns. There will be a new consciousness of national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
life, with a corresponding glow. The soul will dilate
with the assured unity of the Republic, and all will feel
the glory of its citizenship. Since that of Rome, nothing
so commanding. Local jealousies and geographical
distinctions will be lost in the attractions of a common
country. Then, indeed, there will be no North,
no South, no East, no West; but there will be One
Nation. No single point of the compass, but the whole
horizon, will receive our regard. Not the Southern Cross
flaming with beauty, not even the North Star, long time
guide of the mariner and refuge to the flying bondman,
but the whole star-spread firmament, will be our
worship and delight.</p>

<p>As the Nation stands confessed in undivided sovereignty,
the States will not cease their appropriate functions.
Interlocked, interlaced, and harmonized, they will
be congenial parts of the mighty whole, with Liberty
and Equality the recognized birthright of all, and no
local pretension to interfere against the universal law.
There will be a sphere alike for the States and Nation.
Local self-government, which is the pride of our institutions,
will be reconciled with the national supremacy
in maintenance of human rights, and the two together
will constitute the elemental principles of the Republic.
The States will exercise a minute jurisdiction required
for the convenience of all; the Nation will exercise that
other paramount jurisdiction required for the protection
of all. The reconciliation&mdash;God bless the word!&mdash;thus
begun will embrace the people, who, forgetting
past differences, will feel more than ever that they are
One, and it will invigorate the still growing Republic,
whose original root was little more than an acorn, so
that it will find new strength to resist the shock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
tempest or time, while it overarches the continent with
its generous shade. Such, at least, is the aspiration in
which all may unite.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 21st, Congress reassembled, pursuant to the

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I question whether we should leave even the

The point is just this: Will you leave to the President
one half-hour within which he may take advantage of
the absence of Congress, and issue commissions which
would perhaps run&mdash;I do not decide the point now,
but which, I say, might run to the last day of the next

it that an appointment during that interim of half an

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds</span> [of Vermont]. But the law takes no notice
of parts of a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> That is a technicality. Why open the

<p>Mr. Grimes, following the suggestion, altered his motion to “twelve
o’clock.” A debate ensued, in which Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Fessenden, of Maine, and Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, took part. Mr.
Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p>I hope that what we do will be for the welfare of
the country, and with no reference to mere rumors or
reports. There I agree with my friend; but then I do
not agree with him, when he says, Give the President
another chance. We have been giving him chances,
and we cannot act now without taking into consideration
his character and position, which have become
matters of history. I would speak with proper delicacy,
with proper reserve, but I must speak under the
responsibility of a Senator. A large portion of our country
believe the President a wicked man, of evil thoughts
and unpatriotic purposes, in spirit and conduct the successor
of Jefferson Davis, through whom the Rebellion
is revived. Such are the sentiments of a large portion
of our people.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Dixon</span> [of Connecticut]. I desire to ask the Senator
if that is the opinion of a majority of the American
people, in his judgment.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It is unquestionably the opinion of
a large portion of the people of the United States;
whether a majority or not the future may disclose. I
will not anticipate any such judgment. I speak now
with reference to what is before us. The question is,
whether we shall give him another opportunity. I say,
No. And here I act on no floating rumor, to which
the Senator from Illinois refers; I act with reference
to the character of the chief magistrate, displayed in
his public conduct. It seems to me that it will be
something like rashness, if the Senate concede to him
another occasion to practise on the country in carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
out his policy, as we know he has practised in times
past. We must stop the way. We should not give
him a day; we should not give him five minutes,&mdash;I
am ready to say that,&mdash;not five minutes, for the
chance of illegitimate power. I will not allow him
to exercise it, and then take my chance hereafter of
applying the corrective.</p>

<p>And that brings me to the exact point as to whether
the present session should expire precisely when the
coming session begins. I see no reason why it should
not. I see no reason why we should interpose the
buffer even of five minutes. Let one session come close
upon the other, and then we shall exclude every possibility
of evil consequences. In France, during the
old monarchy, when the king died, the moment the
breath was out of his body the reign of his successor
began, so that the cry, “The king is dead,” was followed
instantly by another cry, “Long live the king!” Now
I know not why, when this session expires, we may
not at the same time announce its expiration and announce
a new session.</p>

ASSENT BY A STATE.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on the Resolutions of the Legislature
of Ohio rescinding its former Resolution in Ratification of
the Fourteenth Amendment, January 31, 1868.</span></p>

<p class="dropcap">The resolutions from the Legislature of Ohio are so
important in character, and so wholly without precedent,
I believe, in our history, that I think they justify
remark even by a Senator who has not the honor
of any special association with that State.</p>

<p>It seems to me very clear that the authors of these
resolutions have accomplished nothing except to exhibit
their own blind prejudices. By the Constitution
of the United States, a State may give its assent to a
Constitutional Amendment. There is no provision for
any withdrawal of such assent, when once given. The
assent of the State, once given, is final. A State, I do
not hesitate to say, can no more withdraw such assent
than it can withdraw from the Union; and on the latter
proposition I believe there is now a universal accord.</p>

<p>But, happily, Sir, this extraordinary effort of an accidental
Legislature is absolutely impotent. The Amendment
in question is already a part of the Constitution
of the United States, and in full vigor, even without
the assent of Ohio. By a report from the Secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
State it appears that there is official evidence of the
assent of the Legislatures of Connecticut, New Hampshire,
Tennessee, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, New
York, Illinois, West Virginia, Kansas, Nevada, Missouri,
Indiana, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Massachusetts, and Nebraska,&mdash;being
twenty in all, without Ohio. To these now we may
add Iowa, which has given its assent very recently,
and also Maine, which has notoriously given its assent,
although I understand it has not been officially communicated
to the Department of State,&mdash;making, therefore,
twenty-two States, even without Ohio. Twenty-two
States are more than three fourths of the Loyal
States, or, in other words, of those States that at this
moment have Legislatures. The full requirement of the
Constitution is therefore met.</p>

<p>This Amendment was originally proposed by a vote
of two thirds of Congress, composed of the representatives
of the Loyal States. It has now been ratified by
the Legislatures of three fourths of the Loyal States,
being the same States which originally proposed it
through their representatives in Congress. The States
that are competent to propose a Constitutional Amendment
are competent to adopt it. Both things have been
done. The required majority in Congress have proposed
it; the required majority of States have adopted
it. Therefore, I say, this resolution of the Legislature
of Ohio is <i>brutum fulmen</i>,&mdash;impotent as words without
force. It can have no practical effect, except to
disclose the character of its authors. As such it may
be dismissed to the limbo of things lost on earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I wish to remind the Senator from
Maryland of the exact words of the Constitution, which
were not, it seems to me, in his mind when he spoke.
An Amendment, when proposed, “shall be valid to all
intents and purposes as part of this Constitution, when
ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several
States.” It does not say, “when ratified by three
fourths of the several States,” but “by the ‘Legislatures’
of three fourths of the several States.” Now,
if there are States without Legislatures, they can have
no voice in the ratification. Apply this practically.
Three fourths of the actual Legislatures of this Union
have ratified the proposed Amendment, and I insist, on
the text of the Constitution, and also on the reason of
the case, that such ratification is complete. But I am
unwilling that this argument should stand merely on
my words. I introduce here the authority of the best
living text-writer on the jurisprudence of our country,
who has treated this very point in a manner which
leaves no opportunity for reply. I refer to the book
of Mr. Bishop on the Criminal Law, who, in one of his
notes,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> considers whether the Amendment of the Constitution
abolishing Slavery had been at the time he wrote
adopted in a constitutional manner. Of course the very
question which we are now discussing with reference to
the Fourteenth Amendment arises also on the Amendment
prohibiting Slavery. They are both in the same
predicament. If the Fourteenth Amendment is not now
a part of the Constitution of the United States, then
the Amendment prohibiting Slavery is not a part of the
Constitution of the United States. They both stand on
the same bottom; they were both proposed by Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in the same way,&mdash;that is, by a vote of two thirds of
the representatives of the Loyal States; and they have
both been ratified by the votes of three fourths of the
States having Legislatures. I send to the Chair the
work of Mr. Bishop, and I ask the Secretary to be good
enough to read what I have marked.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 13th, the question of the admission of Hon. Philip F.
Thomas, Senator-elect from Maryland, charged with disloyalty, coming
up for consideration, on a resolution of Hon. Reverdy Johnson,
of that State, that said Thomas “be admitted to his seat on his
taking the oaths prescribed by the Constitution and laws of the United
States,” Mr. Sumner moved the following substitute:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That Philip F. Thomas, Senator-elect from Maryland, cannot be admitted
to take the oaths of office required by the Constitution and laws,
inasmuch as he allowed his minor son to leave the paternal house to
serve as a Rebel soldier, and gave him at the time one hundred dollars
in money, all of which was ‘aid,’ ‘countenance,’ or ‘encouragement’ to the
Rebellion, which he was forbidden to give; and further, inasmuch as in
forbearing to disclose and make known the treason of his son to the President,
or other proper authorities, according to the requirement of the
statute in such cases, he was guilty of misprision of treason as defined
by existing law.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">A great debate on the question how loyalty shall
be secured in the Rebel States is for the time
silenced in order to consider how loyalty shall be
secured in this Chamber. Everywhere in the Rebel
States disloyal persons are struggling for power; and
now at the door of the Senate we witness a similar
struggle. If disloyalty cannot be shut out of this Chamber,
how can we hope to overcome it elsewhere?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>More than once at other times I have discussed the
question of loyalty in the Senate. But this was anterior
to the adoption of the Fourteenth Constitutional
Amendment. The case is plainer now than then, inasmuch
as there is now an explicit text requiring loyalty
as a “qualification.” Formerly we were left to something
in the nature of inference; now the requirement
is plain as language can make it.</p>

<p>By the new Amendment it is provided that “no person
shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress,
… who, having previously taken an oath, as a member
of Congress, or as an officer of the United States,
… to support the Constitution of the United States,
shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against
the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies
thereof.”</p>

<p>These words are precisely applicable to the present
case. They lay down a rule from which there is no
appeal; and this rule is not merely in the statutes, but
in the Constitution. It is the plain declaration that
loyalty is a requirement in a Senator and Representative.
If we do not apply it to ourselves now, it is difficult
to see with what consistency we can apply it to
others. Your course here will affect the meaning of
this Constitutional Amendment, if not its validity for
the future.</p>

<p>I do not stop to argue the question if that Amendment
is now a part of the Constitution; for I would
not unnecessarily occupy your time, nor direct attention
from the case which you are to decide. For the
present I content myself with two remarks: first, the
Amendment has already been adopted by three fourths
of the States that took part in proposing it, and this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
enough, for the spirit of the Constitution is thus satisfied;
and, secondly, it has already been adopted by
“the <i>Legislatures</i> of three fourths of the several States”
which have Legislatures, thus complying with the letter
of the Constitution. Therefore, by the spirit of the
Constitution, and also by its letter, this Amendment is
now a part of the Constitution, binding on all of us.
As such I invoke its application to this case. In face
of this positive, peremptory requirement, it is impossible
to see how loyalty can be other than a “qualification.”
In denying it, you practically set aside this Amendment.</p>

<p>But, even without this Amendment, I cannot doubt
that the original text is sufficiently clear and explicit.
It is nowhere said in the Constitution that certain
specified requirements, and none others, shall be “qualifications”
of Senators. This word “qualifications,”
which plays such a part in this case, occurs in another
connection, where it is provided that “each House shall
be the judge of the elections, returns, and <i>qualifications</i>
of its own members.” What these “qualifications” may
be is to be found elsewhere. Searching the Constitution
from beginning to end, we find three “qualifications,”
which come under the head of <i>form</i>, being (1.)
age, (2.) citizenship, and (3.) inhabitancy in the State.
But behind and above these is another “qualification,”
which is of <i>substance</i>, in contradiction to <i>form</i> only. So
supreme is this, that it is placed under the safeguard of
an oath. This is loyalty. It is easy to see how infinitely
more important is this than either of the others,&mdash;than
age, than citizenship, or than inhabitancy in
the State. A Senator failing in either of these would
be incompetent by the letter of the Constitution; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the Republic might not suffer from his presence. On
the other hand, a Senator failing in loyalty is a public
enemy, whose presence in this council-chamber would
be a certain peril to the Republic.</p>

<p>It is vain to say that loyalty is not declared to be
a “qualification.” I deny it. Loyalty is made a “qualification”
in the Amendment to the Constitution; and
then again in the original text, when, in the most solemn
way possible, it is distinguished and guarded by
an oath. Men are familiarly said to “qualify,” when
they take the oath of office; and thus the language of
common life furnishes an authentic interpretation of
the Constitution.</p>

<p>But no man can be allowed to take the oath as Senator,
when, on the evidence before the Senate, he is not
competent. If it appear that he is not of sufficient
age, or of the required citizenship or inhabitancy, he
cannot be allowed to go to that desk. Especially if it
appear that he fails in the all-important “qualification”
of loyalty, he cannot be allowed to go to that desk. A
false oath, taken with our knowledge, would compromise
the Senate. We who consent will become parties
to the falsehood; we shall be parties in the offence.
It is futile to say that the oath is one of purgation only,
and that it is for him who takes it to determine on his
conscience if he can take it. The Senate cannot forget
the evidence; nor can its responsibility in the case be
swallowed up in any process of individual purgation.
On the evidence we must judge, and act accordingly.
The “open sesame” of this Chamber must be something
more than the oath of a suspected applicant.</p>

<p>According to Lord Coke, “an infidel cannot be sworn”
as a witness. This was an early rule, which has since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
been softened in our courts. But, under the Constitution
of the United States and existing statutes, a <i>political
infidel</i> cannot be sworn as a Senator. Whatever
may be his inclination or motive, he must not be allowed
to approach your desk. The country has a right
to expect that all who enter here shall have a sure and
well-founded loyalty, above all question or suspicion.
And such, I insist, is the rule of the Constitution and
of Congress.</p>

<p>As if to place the question beyond all doubt, Congress
by positive enactment requires that every Senator,
before admission to his seat, shall swear that he
has “voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel, or
encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility”
to the United States.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Here is little more than an interpretation
of the Constitution. The conclusion is plain.
No person who has voluntarily given even “countenance”
or “encouragement” to another engaged in the
Rebellion can be allowed to take that oath.</p>

<p>After this statement of the rule, the question arises,
if Philip F. Thomas can be permitted to take the oath
at your desk, or, in other words, to “qualify” as a Senator
of the United States. Is he competent? This is
a question of evidence.</p>

<p>The ample discussion of the facts in this case, and
their singular plainness, supersede the necessity of all
details. The atmosphere about Mr. Thomas and his
acts are harmonious. From the beginning we find
him enveloped in coldness and indifference while his
country was in peril. Observing him more closely, we
are shocked by two acts of positive disloyalty, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
which is the natural prelude of the other. The first
muttering of the Rebellion found him a member of the
Cabinet of Mr. Buchanan; but when this uncertain
President proposed the succor of our troops at Charleston,
already menaced with war, Mr. Thomas withdrew
from the patriotic service. He resigned his seat, following
the lead of Cobb, Thompson, and Floyd. A
man is known by the company he keeps. His company
at this time were traitors, and the act they united
in doing was essentially disloyal. As the Rebellion assumed
the front of war, they all abandoned their posts:
some to join the Rebellion and mingle with its armies;
Mr. Thomas, more prudently, to watch the course of
events in Maryland, ready to lift his arm also, if his
State pronounced the word. This concerted desertion
was in itself a conspiracy against the Government; and
in the case of Mr. Thomas, who was Secretary of the
Treasury, it was a blow at the national credit, which
it was his special duty to guard. It was an act of disloyalty
to be blasted by indignant history, even if your
judgment fails now. And this was the first stage in
this record.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the war rages. Armies are marshalled;
battles ensue; Washington itself is beleaguered; the
Republic trembles with peril. But Mr. Thomas continues
in the seclusion of his home, enveloped in the
same disloyal atmosphere, and refusing always the oath
of allegiance. At last, in 1863, an only son arrives at
the age of eighteen. Though still a minor, he is already
of the military age. Naturally filled with the sentiments
of his father’s fireside, he seeks to maintain them
by military service. He is like his father, but with
the ardor of youth instead of the caution of years. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
avows his purpose to enlist in the Rebel army, thus
to levy war against his country, and adhere to its enemies.
All this was treason,&mdash;plain, palpable, unquestionable,
downright treason. Instead of detaining his
son,&mdash;instead of keeping him back,&mdash;instead of interposing
a paternal veto,&mdash;instead of laying hands gently
upon him,&mdash;instead of denouncing him to the magistrate,&mdash;all
of which the father might have done,&mdash;he
deliberately lets him go, and then, to cap the climax of
criminal complicity, furnishes the means for his journey
and his equipment. He gives one hundred dollars. The
father is not rich, and yet he gives this considerable
sum. Few soldiers started with such ample allowance.
Thus it stands: the father, who has already deserted
his post in the Cabinet, and has refused to take the
oath of allegiance to his country, contributes a soldier
to the Rebellion, and that soldier is his only son; to
complete and assure the great contribution, he contributes
a sum of money also. If all this accumulated disloyalty,
beginning in a total renunciation of every patriotic
duty, and finally consummated by an act of flagrant,
unblushing enormity, is not “aid and comfort”
or “countenance” or “encouragement” to the Rebellion,
it is difficult to say what can be. There must be
new dictionaries for these familiar words, and they must
receive a definition down to this day unknown. They
must be treated as thread or gossamer, when they should
be links of iron.</p>

<p>On an occasion like the present, where the moral
guilt is so patent, I hesitate to employ technical language.
The simplest phrase is the best. But the law
supplies language of its own. Regarding the act of Mr.
Thomas in the mildest light, it was “misprision of treason,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
according to every definition of that crime which
can be found in the books. Lord Hale, whose authority,
in stating the rules of Criminal Law, is of the highest
character, says, under this head: “Every man is bound
to use all possible lawful means to prevent a felony, as
well as to take the felon; and if he doth not, he is liable
to a fine and imprisonment.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Lord Coke, another
eminent authority, says: “If any be present when a
man is slain, and omit to apprehend the slayer, it is a
misprision.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The same rule is, of course, applicable to
treason. Mr. Bishop, who in his remarkable work on
the Criminal Law has compressed the result of all the
authorities, says: “Misprision of felony is a criminal
neglect, either to prevent a felony from being committed
by another, or to bring to justice a person known to
be guilty of felony. Misprision of treason is the same
of treason.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Then again he says, citing Hawkins,
Blackstone, East, and Russell, all familiar names in our
courts, each an oracle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The doctrine of misprision, as now understood, may be
stated as follows: To make a man liable for a crime committed
through the physical volition of another, his own will
must in some degree concur in or contribute to the crime.
<i>But when it is treason or felony, and he stands by while it
is done, without using the means in his power to prevent it,
though his will concurs not in it,&mdash;or when he knows of its
having been in his absence committed, but neither makes disclosure
of it to the authorities nor does anything to bring the
offender to punishment</i>,&mdash;the law holds him guilty of a breach
of the duty due from every man to the community wherein
he dwells and the government which protects him.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>I adduce these authorities in order to show, that, by
the Common Law, as illustrated by some of its best
names, Mr. Thomas is beyond all question an offender.
Clearly he did not use “the means in his power” to
prevent the treason of his son, nor did he “make disclosure
of it to the authorities,” according to the received
rule of law.</p>

<p>But the statutes of the United States leave us no
room for doubt or indulgence. According to the precise
text, the present case is anticipated and provided
for. The Statute of Crimes, adopted in 1790, at the
beginning of the National Government, after declaring
the punishment of treason, proceeds to declare the punishment
of “misprision of treason,” as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, if <i>any person or persons, having knowledge of the
commission of any of the treasons aforesaid, shall conceal and
not as soon as may be disclose and make known the same</i> to
the President of the United States or some one of the Judges
thereof, or to the President or Governor of a particular State
or some one of the Judges or Justices thereof, <i>such person or
persons, on conviction, shall be adjudged guilty of misprision
of treason</i>, and shall be imprisoned not exceeding seven years,
and fined not exceeding one thousand dollars.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Apply these plain words to the present case. Nobody
can doubt that Mr. Thomas had “knowledge” of
the treason of his son, and, having this knowledge,
failed to “disclose and make known the same” to the
President of the United States or the other proper authorities.
Abraham Lincoln was at the time President.
There is no pretence that the father communicated the
crime of the son to this patriot magistrate, or to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
other loyal officer by whom he could have been arrested.
Therefore, beyond all question, on the facts of
the case, the father is guilty under the statute, and
liable to seven years of imprisonment and a fine of
one thousand dollars. And now, instead of seven years
of imprisonment and a fine of one thousand dollars, it
is proposed to give him six years of trust and honor as
a Senator of the United States, with an annual allowance
of five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>According to the old law, the indictment against Mr.
Thomas would allege, that, “not having the fear of God
before his eyes, but being moved and seduced by the
instigation of the Devil,” he perpetrated his crime. And
now, with this crime unatoned for, he comes here to
ask your support and countenance. We are to forget all
that he did, “moved and seduced” by evil instigation,
and welcome him to this Chamber, instead of handing
him over to judgment.</p>

<p>It is treating this case with a levity which it is hard
to pardon, when Senators argue that the father was not
under obligations to exercise all the paternal power in
restraint of his son, or at least in denouncing him to
the proper authorities. What is patriotism, what is
the sacred comprehensive charity of country, if a father
can be blameless after such a license to his son? The
country was another mother to this son, and he went
away to strike this mother on the bosom. There is a
case in antiquity which illustrates the solemn duty of
the father at least to detain the son. I quote from Sallust.
This remarkable writer, in his history of the Catilinarian
conspiracy, tells us that there were many not
enlisted in the conspiracy who went out to join Catiline;
that among these was Aulus Fulvius, the son of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Senator; and the historian adds, without comment, that
the father, when his son was brought back, ordered him
to be slain: “<i>Fuere tamen extra conjurationem complures,
qui ad Catilinam profecti sunt: in his A. Fulvius,
Senatoris filius; quem retractum ex itinere parens necari
jussit</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Humanity rejects the barbarous exercise of the
paternal power according to the Roman Law; but patriotism
may find even in this example a lesson of paternal
duty. The American father should not have slain
his son, but he should have kept him from joining the
enemies of his country. This requirement of duty was
none the less strong because not enforced by death. I
utter not only the rule of patriotism, but the rule of
law, when I say that it was positive and peremptory.
I will not admit that an American citizen can be blameless
who dismisses a son from the paternal roof with
money in his purse, to make war upon his country. All
that the son did afterward, all that the son sought to do,
became the act of the father who sent him forth on his
parricidal errand. The father’s treason was continued
and protracted in the treason of the son.</p>

<p>In making this contribution to the Rebellion, the act
of the father was enhanced by his eminent position.
He had held a seat in the Cabinet, binding him more
than any common citizen to the most watchful allegiance,
and giving to what he did peculiar importance.
A soldier contributed to the Rebellion by such a person
was a startling event. It was aid and comfort,
countenance and encouragement, of far-reaching significance.
It was a hostile act, directly injurious to his
country, and of evil example, the influence of which no
man can measure. How many others were weakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
in loyalty by this parricidal act who can tell? When
the citizen who has enjoyed public trust and been a
“pillar of State” gives way, others about him must fall
likewise. So great a parricide must cause other parricides.</p>

<p>And now this father, who gave a son to the Rebellion,
comes into this sanctuary of the Constitution,
where loyalty is the first condition of admission, and
asks for a seat. <i>Immo in Senatum venit.</i> Is there not
hardihood in the application? Of course, he cannot be
admitted without your act having an influence proportioned
to the importance of the position. It will be felt
everywhere throughout the country. Admit him, and
you will unloose the bonds of loyalty and give a new
license to the Rebellion in its protracted struggle. On
the contrary, if you send him away, you will furnish a
warning to the disloyal, and teach a lesson of patriotism
which will thrill the hearts of good citizens now
anxiously watching for peace and reconciliation through
the triumph of loyalty.</p>

<p>I speak this positively, because on this case I see no
doubt. The facts are indisputable, and over all towers
one supreme act of parricide, for which there can be no
excuse or apology. A soldier was contributed to the
enemies of his country. There is no question of motive.
The parricidal act was complete, and it explains
itself. There is no doubt that it was done. In the
presence of such an act, so absolutely criminal, there
can be no room for inquiry as to the motive. All this
I put aside and look only at the transcendent fact, in
which all pretence of innocence is so entirely lost and
absorbed that it cannot be seen. As well seek to find
a motive, if a son struck at the bosom of his mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
The law supplies the motive, when it says, in its ancient
phrase, “moved and seduced by the instigation of the
Devil.”</p>

<p>Some there are who doubt the motive of the father,
and claim for him now the benefit of that doubt. Even
if the motive of this criminal act were in question, as I
insist that it cannot be, then do I say, that, in a case
like this, when disloyalty is to be shut out of this
Chamber, I give the benefit of doubt to my country.</p>

<p>There is another voice which sometimes reaches me.
We are told, that, if the applicant be disloyal, then we
may expel him. For myself, I prefer to take no such
risk. Viewing the case as I do, I have no right to
take any such risk. Disloyalty must be met at the
door, and not allowed to enter in. The old verses, more
than once repeated in our public discussions, are applicable
now,&mdash;never more so:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;Pardon my delay. There are
two ways of dealing with the question of International
Copyright,&mdash;one by the treaty power, and the
other by reciprocal legislation.</p>

<p>I have always thought that the former was the easier,
but at the present moment the House of Representatives
is not disposed to concede much to the treaty
power.</p>

<p>Mr. Everett, while Secretary of State, negotiated a
treaty on this subject with Great Britain, which was
submitted to the Senate, reported by the Committee on
Foreign Relations, considered in the Senate, and finally
left on the table, without any definitive vote.</p>

<p>I shall send you a copy of this treaty, which, I believe,
has never seen the light.</p>

<p>I have always been in favor of an International Copyright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
as justice to authors and a new stage in the unity
of nations. Perhaps the condition of public affairs at
this time, the preoccupation of the public mind, the
imminence of the Presidential election, and also the
alienation from England, may present temporary obstacles.
But I am sanguine that at last the victory will
be won. If authors should have a copyright anywhere,
they should have it everywhere within the limits of civilization.</p>

<p>Accept my best wishes, and believe me, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I shall not attempt to follow
learned Senators in the question whether this is
a Senate or a Court. That question, to my mind, is
simply one of language, and not of substance. Our
powers at this moment are under the Constitution of
the United States; nor can we add to them a tittle
by calling ourselves a Court or calling ourselves a Senate.
There they are in the Constitution. Search its
text and you will find them. The Constitution has
not given us a name, but it has given us powers; and
those we are now to exercise. The Senate has the
sole power to try impeachments. No matter for the
name, Sir. I hope that I do not use an illustration
too familiar, when I remind you that a rose under any
other name has all those qualities which make it the
first of flowers.</p>

<p>I should not at this time have entered into this discussion,
if I had not listened to objections on the other
side which seem to me founded, I will not say in error,
for that would be bold when we are discussing a question
of so much novelty, but I will say founded in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
reading of history which I have not been able to verify.
Senator after Senator on the other side, all distinguished
by ability and learning, have informed us that the Constitution
intended to prevent a person who might become
President from presiding at the trial of the President.
I would ask learned Senators who have announced
this proposition, where they find it in the
Constitution. The Constitution says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When the President of the United States is tried, the
Chief Justice shall preside.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is all; and yet on this simple text the superstructure
of Senators has been reared.</p>

<p>The Constitution does not proceed to say why the
Chief Justice shall preside; not at all; nothing of the
kind. Senators supply the reason, and then undertake to
apply it to the actual President of the Senate. Where,
Sir, do they find the reason? They cannot find the
reason which they now assign in any of the contemporary
authorities illustrating the Constitution; they cannot
find it in the debates of the National Convention
reported by Madison, or in any of the debates in the
States at that time; nor can they find it in the “Federalist.”
When does that reason first come on the scene?
Others may be more fortunate than I; but I have not
been able to find it earlier than 1825, nearly forty years
after the formation of the Constitution, in the Commentaries
of William Rawle. We all know the character
of this work,&mdash;one of great respectability, and
which most of us in our early days have read and
studied. How does he speak of it? As follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Vice-President, being the President of the Senate,
presides on the trial, except when the President of the
United States is tried. As the Vice-President succeeds to
the functions and emoluments of the President of the United
States, whenever a vacancy happens in the latter office, it
would be inconsistent with the implied purity of a judge
that a person under a probable bias of such a nature should
participate in the trial, and it would follow that he should
wholly retire from the court.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Those are the words of a commentator on the Constitution.
They next appear eight years later, in the
Commentaries of Mr. Justice Story. After citing the
provision, “When the President of the United States
is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside,” the learned
commentator proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The reason of this clause has been already adverted to.
It was to preclude the Vice-President, who might be supposed
to have a natural desire to succeed to the office, from
being instrumental in procuring the conviction of the Chief
Magistrate.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And he cites in his note “Rawle on the Constitution,
ch. 22, p. 216,”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> being the very passage that I have
just read. Here is the first appearance of this reason,
which is now made to play so important a part, being
treated even as a text of the Constitution itself. At
least I have not been able to meet it at an earlier day.</p>

<p>If you repair to the contemporary authorities, including
the original debates, you will find no such reason
assigned,&mdash;nothing like it,&mdash;not even any suggestion
of it. On the contrary, you will find Mr. Madison, in
the Virginia Convention, making a statement which explains
in the most satisfactory manner the requirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> No better authority could be cited.
Any reason supplied by him anterior to the adoption of
the Constitution must be of more weight than any <i>ex
post facto</i> imagination or invention of learned commentators.</p>

<p>If we trust to the lights of history, the reason for the
introduction of this clause in the Constitution was because
the framers of the Constitution contemplated the
possibility of the suspension of the President from the
exercise of his powers, in which event the Vice-President
could not be in your chair, Sir. If the President
were suspended, the Vice-President would be in his
place. The reports will verify what I say. If you refer
to the debates of the National Convention, under the
date of Friday, September 14, 1787, you will find the
following entry, which I read now by way of introduction
to what follows at a later date, on the authority of
Mr. Madison himself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Rutledge and Mr. Gouverneur Morris moved ‘that
persons impeached be suspended from their offices until they
be tried and acquitted.’</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Madison.</span> The President is made too dependent
already on the Legislature by the power of one branch to
try him in consequence of an impeachment by the other.
This intermediate suspension will put him in the power of
one branch only. They can at any moment, in order to
make way for the functions of another who will be more
favorable to their views, vote a temporary removal of the
existing magistrate.</p>

<p>“Mr. King concurred in the opposition to the amendment.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>e proposition was rejected by the decisive vote of
eight States in the negative to three in the affirmative.
We all see, in reading it now, that it was rejected on
good grounds. It would obviously be improper to confer
upon the other branch of Congress the power, by
its own vote, to bring about a suspension of the Chief
Magistrate. But it did not follow, because the Convention
rejected the proposition that a suspension could
take place on a simple vote of the House of Representatives,
that therefore the President could not be suspended.
When the Senate was declared to have the
sole power to try impeachments, it was by necessary
implication invested with the power, incident to every
court, and known historically to belong to the English
court of impeachment, from which ours was borrowed,
of suspending the party accused. All this was apparent
at the time, if possible, more clearly than now.
It was so clear, that it furnishes an all-sufficient reason
for the provision that the Chief Justice should preside
on the trial of the President, without resorting to
the later reason which has been put forward in this
debate.</p>

<p>But we are not driven to speculate on this question.
While the Constitution was under discussion in the
Virginia Convention, George Mason objected to some
of the powers conferred upon the President, especially
the pardoning power. This was on June 18, 1788, and
will be found under that date in the reports of the Virginia
Convention. This earnest opponent of the Constitution
said that the President might “pardon crimes
which were advised by himself,” and thus further his
own ambitious schemes. This brought forward Mr.
Madison, who had sat, as we all know, throughout the
debates of the National Convention, and had recorded
its proceedings, and who, of all persons, was the mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>st
competent to testify at that time as to the intention of
the framers. What said this eminent authority? I
give you his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is one security in this case to which gentlemen
may not have adverted. If the President be connected in
any suspicious manner with any person, and there be grounds
to believe he will shelter him, the House of Representatives
can impeach him; they”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">evidently referring to the Senate, or the Senate in connection
with the House&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“can remove him, if found guilty; <i>they can suspend him,
when suspected</i>, and the power will devolve on the Vice-President.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mark well these words,&mdash;“they can suspend him,
when suspected.” If only suspected, the President can
be suspended. What next? “And his power will
devolve on the Vice-President.” In which event, of
course, the Vice-President would be occupied elsewhere
than in this Chamber.</p>

<p>Those were the words of James Madison, spoken in
debate in the Virginia Convention. Taken in connection
with the earlier passage in the National Convention,
they seem to leave little doubt with regard to the
intention of the framers of the Constitution. They were
unwilling to give to the other House alone the power
of suspension; but they saw, that, when they authorized
the Senate to try impeachments, they gave to it
the power of suspension, if it should choose to exercise
it; and the suspension of the President necessarily involved
the withdrawal of the Vice-President from this
Chamber, and the duty of supplying his place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>I submit, then, on the contemporary testimony, that
the special reason why the Chief Justice is called to
preside, when the President is on trial, is less what
learned Senators have assigned than because the Vice-President
under certain circumstances would not be
able to be present. It was to provide for such a contingency,
being nothing less than his necessary absence
in the discharge of the high duties of Chief Magistrate,
that a substitute was necessary, and he was
found in the Chief Justice. All this was reasonable.
It would have been unreasonable not to make such a
provision.</p>

<p>But this is not all. There is an incident, immediately
after the adoption of the Constitution, which is
in harmony with this authentic history. The House
of Representatives at an early day acted on the interpretation
of the Constitution given by Mr. Madison.
The first impeachment, as we all know, was of William
Blount, a Senator, and in impeaching him the House
of Representatives demanded that he should “be sequestered
from his seat in the Senate.” This was in
1797. The Senate did not comply with this demand;
but the demand nevertheless exists in the history of
your Government, and it illustrates the interpretation
which was given at that time to the powers of the
Senate. The language employed, that the person impeached
should be “sequestered,” is the traditional language
of the British Constitution, constantly used, and
familiar to our fathers. In employing it, the House
of Representatives gave their early testimony that the
Senate could suspend from his functions any person
impeached before them; and thus the House of Representatives
unite with Madison in supplying a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
reason for the provision that on the trial of the President
the Chief Justice shall preside.</p>

<p>In abandoning the reason which I have thus traced
to contemporary authority, you launch upon an uncertain
sea. You may think the reason assigned by the
commentators to be satisfactory. It may please your
taste; but it cannot be accepted as an authentic statement.
If the original propositions were before me, I
should listen to any such suggestion with the greatest
respect. I do not mean to say now, that, as a general
rule, it has not much in its favor; but I insist, that, so
far as we are informed, the reason of the commentators
was an afterthought, and that there was another reason
which sufficiently explains the rule now under consideration.</p>

<p>I respectfully submit, Sir, that you cannot proceed in
the interpretation of this text upon the theory adopted
by the learned Senators over the way. You must take
the text as it is. You cannot go behind it; you cannot
extend it. Here it is: “When the President of
the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.”
That is the whole, Sir. “The Chief Justice shall
preside.” No reason is assigned. Can you assign a reason?
Can you supply a reason? Especially can you
supply one which is not sustained by the authentic
contemporary history of the Constitution, and particularly
when you have authentic contemporary history
which supplies another reason? Unless I am much
mistaken, this disposes of the objection, proceeding
from so many Senators, that the Senator from Ohio
cannot take the oath because he may possibly succeed
to the President now impeached at your bar. He may
vote or not, as he pleases; and there is no authorit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>y in
the Constitution, or any of its contemporary expounders,
to criticize him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is all, Sir, I have to say at this time on this
head. There were other remarks made by Senators
over the way to which I might reply. There was one
that fell from my learned friend, the Senator from Maryland,
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>,] in which he alluded to myself.
He represented me as having cited many authorities
from the House of Lords, tending to show, in the case
of Mr. Stockton, that this person at the time was not
entitled to vote on the question of his seat. The Senator
does not remember that debate, I think, as well
as I do. The point which I tried to present to the
Senate, and which, I believe, was affirmed by a vote
of the body, was simply this: that a man cannot sit
as a judge in his own case. That was all,&mdash;at least
so far as I recollect; and I submitted that Mr. Stockton
at that time was a judge undertaking to sit in his
own case.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Pray, Sir, what is the pertinency of this
citation? Is it applicable at all to the Senator from
Ohio? Is his case under consideration? Is he impeached
at the bar of the Senate? Is he in any way
called in question? Is he to answer for himself? Not
at all. How, then, does the principle of law, that no
man shall sit as a judge in his own case, apply to him?
How does the action of the Senate in the case of Mr.
Stockton apply to him? Not at all. The two cases
are as wide as the poles asunder. One has nothing to
do with the other.</p>

<p>Something has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> said of the “interest” of the Senator
from Ohio on the present occasion. “Interest”!
This is the word used. We are reminded that in a
certain event the Senator may become President, and
that on this account he is under peculiar temptations,
which may swerve him from justice. The Senator from
Maryland went so far as to remind us of the large salary
to which he might succeed,&mdash;not less than twenty-five
thousand dollars a year,&mdash;and thus added a pecuniary
temptation to the other disturbing forces. Is not
all this very technical? Does it not forget the character
of this great proceeding? Sir, we are a Senate, and
not a Court of <i>Nisi Prius</i>. This is not a case of assault
and battery, but a trial involving the destinies of
this Republic. I doubt if the question of “interest” is
properly raised. I speak with all respect for others,
but I submit that it is inapplicable. It does not belong
here. Every Senator has his vote, to be given on his
conscience. If there be any “interest” to sway him,
it must be that of justice, and the safety of the country.
Against these all else is nothing. The Senator from
Ohio, whose vote is now in question, can see nothing
but those transcendent interests by the side of which
office, power, and money are of small account. Put in
one scale these interests, so dear to the heart of the
patriot, and in the other all the personal temptations
which have been imagined, and I cannot doubt, that, if
the Senator from Ohio holds these scales, the latter will
kick the beam.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the course of this trial there was an important claim of power
by the Chief Justice, as presiding officer of the Senate, on which at
the time Mr. Sumner expressed his opinion to the Senate, when it
withdrew for consultation. As this claim was calculated in certain
contingencies to affect the course of proceedings, possibly the final
judgment, and as it might hereafter be drawn into a precedent, Mr.
Sumner was unwilling to lose this opportunity of recording his reasons
against it.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In determining the relations of the Chief Justice to
the trial of the President, we must look, first, to
the National Constitution; for it is solely by virtue of
the National Constitution that this eminent magistrate
is transported from his own natural field to another,
where he is for the time an exotic. The Chief Justice
in his own court is at home; but it is equally clear,
that, when he comes into the Senate, he is a stranger.
Though justly received with welcome and honor, he
cannot expect membership, or anything beyond the powers
derived directly from the National Constitution, by
virtue of which he temporarily occupies the Chair.</p>

<p>Repairing to our authoritative text, we find the only
applicable words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.…
When the President of the United States
is tried, the Chief Justice shall <i>preside</i>: and no person shall
be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the
members present.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is all. The Chief Justice shall <i>preside</i>, but subject
to two limitations specifically declared. First, the
trial is to be by the Senate <i>solely</i>, and nobody else,&mdash;thus
carefully excluding the presiding officer from all
participation, except so far as is implied in the power
to preside; and, secondly, judgment of conviction can
be only by a vote of “two thirds of <i>the members present</i>,”&mdash;thus
again excluding the presiding officer, unless
it is assumed that he is a member of the Senate.</p>

<p>On the face of this text it is difficult to find ambiguity.
Nobody questions that the Chief Justice must
preside. Can anybody question that the trial must be
by the Senate solely, and nobody else? To change this
requirement is to fly in the face of the National Constitution.
Can anybody question that the judgment of
conviction must be by votes of “members present,” and
nobody else? Now, since the Chief Justice is not a
“member” of the Senate, it is plain that he is positively
excluded from vote on the final question. It
only remains that he should “preside.” And here the
question recurs as to the meaning of this familiar term.</p>

<p>The person who presides is simply, according to the
language of our Rules, “presiding officer,” and this designation
is the equivalent or synonym of speaker, and
also of prolocutor, each of which signifies somebody
who speaks for the house. It is not implied that he
votes with the house, much less that he decides for the
house, but only that he is the voice of the house,&mdash;its
speaker. What the house has to say it says through
him; but, except as organ of the house, he is silent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
unless also a member, when to his powers as presiding
officer he superadds the powers of a member also. From
this brief statement it appears at once how limited his
functions must be.</p>

<p>Here I might stop; but, since this question has assumed
unexpected importance, I am induced to go further.
It is easy to show that the language of the National
Constitution, if seen in the light of English parliamentary
history, must have an interpretation identical
with its natural import.</p>

<p>Nothing is clearer than this. If language employed
in the National Constitution had already, at the time
of its formation, received a definite meaning, it must
be interpreted accordingly. Thus, when the Constitution
secures “trial by jury,” it secures that institution
as defined by antecedent English law. So, also, when
it declares that the judicial power shall extend to “all
cases in law and equity” arising under the National
Constitution, it recognizes the distinction between law
and equity peculiar to English law. Courts of Common
Law and Courts of Equity are all implied in this language;
and since there is no further definition of their
powers, we must ascertain them in England. Cushing,
in determining the rules of proceeding in our American
Legislatures, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Such was the practice of the two Houses of the British
Parliament when our ancestors emigrated; … and such has
continued to be, and now is, the practice in that body.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This resource has been most persuasively presented
by Mr. Wirt, in his remarkable argument on the impeachment
of Judge Peck, where he vindicates and expounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the true rule of interpretation.</p>

<p>According to this eminent authority, what he calls
“the English archetypes” were the models for the
framers of the National Constitution. The courts were
fashioned after these “archetypes.” They were instituted
according to “the English <i>originals</i>, to which they
were manifestly referred by the Constitution itself.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Here again I quote the words of Mr. Wirt.</p>

<p>All this is precisely applicable to that part of the
National Constitution under consideration. In essential
features it was borrowed from England. There is
its original, its model, its archetype. Therefore to England
we go.</p>

<p>Not only to England must we go, but also to Parliamentary
Law, as recognized in England at the adoption
of the National Constitution. The powers of a
presiding officer, where not specifically declared, must
be found in Parliamentary Law. The very term <i>preside</i>
is parliamentary. It belongs to the technicalities
of this branch of law, as much as <i>indict</i> belongs to the
technicalities of the Common Law. In determining the
signification of this term, it will be of little avail to
show some local usage, or, perhaps, some decision of
a court. The usage or decision of a Parliament must
be shown. Against this all vague speculation or divination
of reason is futile. I will not encumber this
discussion by superfluous authorities. Insisting that
this question must be determined by Parliamentary
Law, I content myself with adducing the often cited
words of Lord Coke:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And as every court of justice hath laws and customs for
its direction, some by the Common Law, some by the Civil
and Canon Law, some by peculiar laws and customs, etc., so
the High Court of Parliament <i>suis propriis legibus et consuetudinibus
subsistit</i>. It is <i>lex et consuetudo Parliamenti</i>, that

<i>ought to be determined and adjudged and discussed by the
course of the Parliament</i>, and not by the Civil Law, nor yet
by the common laws of this realm used in more inferior
courts.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is the true rule. To “the course of the Parliament”
we must resort. In “the course of the Parliament”
we must find all the powers of a presiding officer,
and all that is implied in the authority to preside.
“The Chief Justice shall preside.” Such is the Constitution.
Nothing is specified with regard to his powers;
nothing is said. What was intended is left to inference
from the language employed, which must be interpreted
according to “the course of the Parliament,” precisely
as what was intended by trial by jury is ascertained
from the Common Law. In the latter case we go to
the Common Law; in the former case we go to “the
course of the Parliament.” You may as well turn away
from the Common Law in the one as from “the course
of the Parliament” in the other. In determining “the
course of the Parliament” we resort to the summary of
text-writers, and, better still, to the authentic instances
of history.</p>

<p>Something has been said in this discussion with regard
to the example of Lord Erskine, who presided at
the impeachment of Lord Melville. This was in 1806,
during the short-lived ministry of Fox, when Erskine
was Chancellor. It is by misapprehension that this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>instance
is supposed to sustain the present assumption.
When seen in its true light, it is found in harmony
with the general rule. Erskine had at the time two
characters. He was Lord Chancellor, and in this capacity
presiding officer of the House of Lords, without
the right to rule or vote, or even to speak. Besides
being Chancellor, he was also a member of the House
of Lords, with all the rights of other members. As we
advance in this inquiry, it will be seen that again and
again it has been practically decided, that, whatever the
powers of a presiding officer who is actually a member,
a presiding officer who is not a member cannot rule or
vote, or even speak. In this statement I anticipate the
argument. I do it at this stage only to put aside the
suggestion founded on the instance of Lord Chancellor
Erskine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I begin with the most familiar authority,&mdash;I mean
the eminent writer and judge, Sir William Blackstone.
In his Commentaries, where is found, in elegant form,
the complete body of English law, you have this whole
matter stated in a few suggestive words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Speaker of the House of Lords, <i>if a Lord of Parliament</i>,
may give his opinion or argue any question in the
House.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If not a Lord of Parliament, he could not give his
opinion or argue any question. This is in accordance
with all the authorities and unbroken usage; but it has
peculiar value at this moment, because it is the text
of Blackstone. This work was the guide-book of our
fathers. It first appeared in 1765-69, the very period
when the controversy with the mother country was f<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>ervid;
and it is an unquestionable fact of history that it
was read in the Colonies with peculiar interest. Burke,
in one of his masterly orations, portraying the character
of our fathers, says: “I hear that they have sold nearly
as many of Blackstone’s Commentaries in America as
in England.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Nothing is clearer than that they knew
it well.</p>

<p>The framers of the National Constitution had it before
them constantly. It was their most familiar work.
It was to them as Bowditch’s Navigator is to the mariner
in our day. They looked to it for guidance on the
sea they were traversing. When they undertook to
provide that the Chief Justice, who was not a member
of the Senate, should preside at the impeachment of
the President, they knew well that he could have no
power to “give his opinion or argue any question in
the House,” for Blackstone had instructed them explicitly
on this head. They knew that he was simply
a presiding officer, according to the immemorial usage
of the upper House in England, with such powers as
belong to a presiding officer who is not a member of
the House, and none other.</p>

<p>The powers of the presiding officer of the House of
Lords are illustrated by authority and precedents, all in
harmony with the statement of Blackstone. Ordinarily
the Keeper of the Great Seal is the presiding officer; but,
unless a member of the body, he can do little more than
put the question. Any other person, as a Chief Justice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
may be delegated by royal commission. According to
the rules of the House, even if a peer, he cannot speak
without quitting the woolsack, which is the Chair, and
moving “to his own place as a peer.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The right of
speech belongs to him as a member, but he cannot exercise
it without leaving his place as presiding officer.
So is he circumscribed.</p>

<p>A late writer on Parliamentary Law, whose work is
a satisfactory guide, thus sententiously sums up the
law and usage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The position of the Speaker of the House of Lords is
somewhat anomalous; for, though he is the president of a
deliberative assembly, he is invested with no more authority
than any other member; and if not himself a member, his
office is limited to the putting of questions and other formal
proceedings.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This statement is in obvious harmony with that of
Blackstone; so that there is no difference between the
writer who is our guide to-day and the learned commentator
who was the guide of our fathers.</p>

<p>Mr. May goes still further, and lets us know that it
is only as a member of the House that the presiding
officer can address it, even on points of order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon points of order, the Speaker, if a peer, may address
the House; but, as his opinion is liable to be questioned,
like that of any other peer, he does not often exercise
his right.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>us, even if a peer, even if a member of the upper
House, the presiding officer cannot rule a point of
order, nor address the House upon it, except as any
other member; and what he says is open to question,
like the utterance of any other member. Such
is the conclusion of the most approved English authority.</p>

<p>American writers on Parliamentary Law concur with
English. Cushing, who has done so much to illustrate
the whole subject, says of the presiding officer of the
Lords, that he “is invested with no more authority for
the preservation of order than any other member; and
if not himself a member, his office is limited to the putting
of questions and other formal proceedings; … if
he is a peer, he may address the House and participate
in the debates as a member.” He then says again: “If
a peer, he votes with the other members; if not, he does
not vote at all.” And he adds: “There is no casting
vote in the Lords.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This statement was made long
after the adoption of the National Constitution, and
anterior to the present controversy.</p>

<p>There are occasions when the Lords have a presiding
officer called a Lord High Steward. This is on the trial
of a peer, whether upon impeachment or indictment.
Here the same rule is stated by Edmund Burke, in his
masterly Report to the House of Commons on the impeachment
of Warren Hastings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every peer present at the trial (and every temporal peer
hath a right to be present in every part of the proceeding)
voteth upon every question of law and fact, and the question
is carried by the major vote,&mdash;the High Steward himself
voting merely as a peer and member of that court,
in common with the rest of the peers, and in no other
right.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>In another place, the Report, quoting the Commons’
Journal, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Lord High Steward was but as a Speaker, or
<i>Chairman</i>, for the more orderly proceeding at the trials.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And then again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The appointment of him doth not alter the nature of
the court, which still remaineth the Court of the Peers in
Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The name of Burke gives to this illustration additional
authority and interest. It is not difficult to see
how he would have decided the present question.</p>

<p>In our day there have been instances of the Lord
Chancellor as presiding officer without being a peer.
Brougham took his seat on the 22d November, 1830,
before his patent as a peer had been made out, and
during this interval his energies were suppressed in the
simple duty of presiding officer and nothing else. The
same was the case with that eminent lawyer, Sir Edward
Sugden, who sat as presiding officer on the 4th
March, 1852, although still a commoner; and it was
also the case with Sir Frederick Thesiger, who sat as
presiding officer on the 1st March, 1858, although still
a commoner. These instances attest the prevalence of
the early rule down to our day. Even Brougham, who
never shrank from speech or from the exercise of power,
was constrained to bow before its exigency. He sat as
Lord Chancellor, and in that character put the question,
but this was all, until he became a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
House. Lord Campbell expressly records, that, while
his name appears in the entry of those present on the
22d November, 1830, as <i>Henricus Brougham, Cancellarius</i>,
“he had no right to debate and vote till the following
day,” when the entry of his name and office
appears as <i>Dominus Brougham et Vaux, Cancellarius</i>.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Passing from these examples of recent history, I return
to the rule as known to our fathers at the adoption
of the National Constitution. On this head the
evidence is complete. It is found in the State Trials
of England, in parliamentary history, and in the books
of law; but it is nowhere better exhibited than in the
Lives of the Chancellors, by Lord Campbell, himself a
member of the House of Lords and a Chancellor, familiar
with it historically and practically. He has stated
the original rule, and in his work, which is as interesting
as voluminous, has furnished constantly recurring
illustrations of it. In the Introduction to his Lives,
where he describes the office of Chancellor, he enunciates
the rule:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whether peer or commoner, the Chancellor is not, like
the Speaker of the Commons, moderator of the proceedings
of the House in which he seems to preside; he is not addressed
in debate; he does not name the peer who is to
be heard; he is not appealed to as an authority on points
of order; and he may cheer the sentiments expressed by his
colleagues in the ministry.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Existing rules of the Senate add to these powers;
but such is the rule with regard to the presiding officer
of the House of Lords, even when a peer. He is not
appealed to on points of order. If a commoner, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
power is still less.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If he be a commoner, notwithstanding a resolution of
the House that he is to be proceeded against for any misconduct
as if he were a peer, he has neither vote nor deliberative
voice, and he can only put the question, and communicate
the resolutions of the House according to the directions
he receives.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the early period of English history the Chancellors
were often ecclesiastics, though generally commoners.
Fortescue, Wolsey, and More were never peers.
This also was the case with Sir Nicholas Bacon, father
of Lord Bacon, who held the seals under Queen Elizabeth
for twenty years, and was colleague in the cabinet
of Burleigh. Lord Campbell remarks on his position as
presiding officer of the House of Lords:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Not being a peer, he could not take a share in the Lords’
debates; but, presiding as Speaker on the woolsack, he exercised
a considerable influence on their deliberations.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again we are told:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Being a commoner, he could neither act as Lord Steward
nor sit upon the trial of the Duke of Norfolk, who was the
first who suffered for favoring Mary’s cause.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus early do we meet illustration of this rule, which
constantly reappears in the annals of Parliament.</p>

<p>The successor of Sir Nicholas Bacon was Lord Chancellor
Bromley; and here we find a record interesting
at this moment. After presiding at the trial of Mary,
Queen of Scots, the Lord Chancellor became ill and
took to his bed. Under the circumstances, Sir Edmund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Anderson, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was authorized
by the Queen to act as a substitute for the
Chancellor; and thus the Chief Justice became presiding
officer of the House of Lords to the close of
the session, without being a peer.</p>

<p>Then came Sir Christopher Hatton, the favorite of
Queen Elizabeth, and so famous as the dancing Chancellor,
who presided in the House of Lords by virtue of
his office, but never as peer. The same was the case
with his successor, Sir John Puckering. He was followed
by the exemplary Ellesmere, who was for many
years Chancellor without being a peer, but finished his
career by adding to his title as presiding officer the
functions of a member. The greatest of all now followed.
After much effort and solicitation, Bacon becomes
Chancellor with a peerage; but it is recorded in
the Lords’ Journals, that, when he spoke, he removed
from the woolsack “to his seat as a peer,” thus attesting
that he had no voice as presiding officer. At last,
when the corruptions of this remarkable character began
to overshadow the land, the Chief Justice of the King’s
Bench, Sir James Ley, was designated by the King to
act as Speaker of the House of Lords. Soon afterward
Bacon fell. Meanwhile it is said that the Chief Justice
“had very creditably performed the duties of Speaker
of the House of Lords.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In other words, according
to the language of our Constitution, he had presided
well.</p>

<p>Then came Williams, Coventry, and Finch, as Lord
Keepers. As the last absconded to avoid impeachment
by the House of Commons, Littleton, Chief Justice of
the Common Pleas, “was placed on the woolsack as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Speaker.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> At a later time he received the Great Seal as
Lord Keeper. This promotion was followed by a peerage,
at the prompting of no less a person than the Earl
of Strafford, “who thought he might be more useful, if
permitted to take part in the proceedings of the House
as a peer, than if he could only put the question as
Speaker.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Clarendon says, that, as a peer, he could
have done Strafford “notable service.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> But the timid
peer did not render the expected service.</p>

<p>Then came the period of Civil War, when one Great
Seal was with the King and another was with Parliament.
Meanwhile the Earl of Manchester was appointed
Speaker of the upper House, and as such took
his place on the woolsack. As a peer he had all the
privileges of a member of the House over which he presided.
Charles the Second, during his exile, appointed
Hyde, afterward Earl of Clarendon, as Chancellor; but
the monarch was for the time without a Court and
without a Parliament. On the Restoration, in 1660,
the Chancellor at once entered upon all his duties,
judicial and parliamentary; and it is recorded, that,
“though still a commoner, holding the Great Seal, he
took his place on the woolsack as Speaker by prescription.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
A year later the commoner was raised to the
peerage, thus becoming more than presiding officer.
During illness from the gout the place of the Chancellor
as presiding officer was sometimes supplied by
Sir Orlando Bridgeman, Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, who on these occasions was presiding officer, and
nothing more. Lord Campbell says he “frequently sa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>t
Speaker in the House of Lords,”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>&mdash;meaning that he
presided.</p>

<p>On the disgrace of Lord Clarendon, the disposal of
the Great Seal was the occasion of perplexity. The
historian informs us, that, “after many doubts and conflicting
plans among the King’s male and female advisers,
it was put into the hands of a grave Common-Law
judge,”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> being none other than the Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas, who had already presided in the
absence of Lord Clarendon; but he was never raised
to the peerage. Then comes another explanation of the
precise relation of such an official to the House. Lord
Campbell expressly remarks, that, “never being created
a peer, his only duty in the House of Lords was to put
the question, and to address the two Houses in explanation
of the royal will on the assembling of Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
Here is the constantly recurring definition
of the term <i>preside</i>.</p>

<p>For some time afterward there seems to have been
little embarrassment. Nottingham, who did so much
for Equity, Shaftesbury, who did so little, Guilford, so
famous through contemporary biography, and Jeffreys,
so justly infamous,&mdash;successively heads of the law,&mdash;were
all peers. But at the Revolution of 1688 there
was an interregnum, which again brought into relief
the relations between the upper House and its presiding
officer. James, on his flight, dropped the Great
Seal into the Thames. There was, therefore, no presiding
officer for the Lords. To supply this want, the
Lords, at the meeting of the Convention Parliament,
chose one of their own number, the Marquis of H<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>alifax,
as Speaker, and, in the exercise of the power inherent
in them, they continued to reëlect him day by
day. During this period he was strictly President <i>pro
tempore</i>. At last, Sir Robert Atkyns, Chief Baron of the
Exchequer, a commoner, took his seat upon the woolsack
as Speaker, appointed by the Crown. Here, again,
we learn that “serious inconvenience was experienced
from the occupier of the woolsack not being a member
of the House.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> At last, in 1693, the Great Seal was
handed to Sir John Somers, Lord Keeper; and here is
another authentic illustration of the rule. Although
official head of the English law, and already exalted
for his ability and varied knowledge, this great man,
one of the saviours of constitutional liberty in England,
was for some time merely presiding officer. The historian
records, that, “while he remained a commoner,
he presided on the woolsack only as Speaker”;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> that
he “had only, as Speaker, to put the question, …
taking no part in debate.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> This is more worthy of
notice because Somers was recognized as a consummate
orator. At last, according to the historian, “there
was a strong desire that he should take part in the debates,
and, to enable him, the King pressed his acceptance
of a peerage, which, after some further delay, he
did, and he was afterward known as Lord Somers.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>In the vicissitudes of public life this great character
was dismissed from office, and a successor was found in
an inferior person, Sir Nathan Wright, who was created
Lord Keeper without a peerage. For the five years of
his official life it is recorded that he occupied the
woolsack, “merely putting the question, and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
no influence over the proceedings.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Thus he presided.</p>

<p>Then came the polished Cowper, at first without a
peerage, but after a short time created a member of the
House. Here again the historian records, that, while he
remained a commoner, “he took his place on the woolsack
as Speaker of the House of Lords, and without a
right to debate or vote.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It appears, that, “not being
permitted to share in the debates in the House of Lords,
he amused himself by taking notes of the speeches on
the opposite sides.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Afterward, even when a peer,
and, as Chancellor, presiding at the impeachment of
Sacheverell, Lord Cowper did not interfere further than
by saying, “Gentlemen of the House of Commons,” or
“Gentlemen, you that are counsel for the prisoner may
proceed.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Harcourt followed Cowper as Keeper of the Great
Seal, but he was not immediately raised to the peerage.
It is recorded that during one year he had “only
to sit as Speaker,”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>&mdash;that is, only to preside. Afterwards,
as peer, he became a member. On the accession
of George the First, Harcourt, in turn, gave place to
Cowper, who was again made Chancellor. To him succeeded
the Earl of Macclesfield, with all the rights of
membership.</p>

<p>Lord Macclesfield, being impeached of high crimes
and misdemeanors as Chancellor, Sir Peter King, at the
time Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was made
presiding officer of the upper House, with only the limited
powers belonging to a presiding officer who is not
a member of the body. Here the record is complete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Turn to the trial and you will see it all. It was he
who gave directions to the managers, and also to the
counsel,&mdash;who put the question, and afterward pronounced
the sentence; but he acted always as presiding
officer and nothing else. I do not perceive that he
made any rulings during the progress of the trial. He
was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, acting as President
<i>pro tempore</i>. The report, describing the opening
of the proceedings, says that the articles of impeachment,
with the answer and replication, were read “by
direction of the Lord Chief Justice King, Speaker of
the House of Lords.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Another definition of the term
<i>preside</i>.</p>

<p>All this is compendiously described by Lord Campbell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sir Peter, not being a peer, of course had no deliberative
voice, but, during the trial, as the organ of the House of
Peers, he regulated the procedure without any special vote,
intimating to the managers and to the counsel for the defendant
when they were to speak and to adduce their evidence.
After the verdict of <i>Guilty</i>, he ordered the Black
Rod to produce his prisoner at the bar; and the Speaker
of the House of Commons having demanded judgment, he,
in good taste, abstaining from making any comment, dryly,
but solemnly and impressively, pronounced the sentence
which the House had agreed upon.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This proceeding was in 1725. At this time, Benjamin
Franklin, the printer-boy, was actually in London.
It is difficult to imagine that this precocious character,
whose observation in public affairs was as remarkable
as in philosophy, should have passed eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
months in London at this very period without noting
this remarkable trial and the manner in which it was
conducted. Thus, early in life, he saw that a Chief Justice
might preside at an impeachment without being a
member of the House of Lords or exercising any of the
powers which belong to membership.</p>

<p>Besides his eminence as Chief Justice, King was the
nephew of the great thinker who has exercised such influence
on English and American opinion, John Locke.
Shortly after presiding at the impeachment as Chief
Justice, he became Chancellor with a peerage.</p>

<p>He was followed in his high post by Talbot and
Hardwicke, each with a peerage. Jumping the long
period of their successful administrations, when the
presiding officer was also a member of the upper House,
I come to another instance where the position of the
presiding officer was peculiarly apparent,&mdash;and this,
too, when Benjamin Franklin was in London, as agent
for Pennsylvania. I refer to Sir Robert Henley, who
became Lord Keeper in 1757, without a peerage. The
King, George the Second, did not like him, and therefore,
while consenting to place him at the head of the
law, declined to make him a member of the House
over which he was to preside. At last, in 1760, the
necessities of the public service constrained his elevation
to the peerage, and soon afterward George the
Third, who succeeded to the throne without the animosities
of his grandfather, created him Chancellor and
Earl of Northington.</p>

<p>For nearly three years, Henley, while still a commoner,
was presiding officer. During this considerable
period he was without voice or vote. The historian
remarks, that, “if there had been any debates, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>he was
precluded from taking part in them.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In another
place he pictures the defenceless condition of the unhappy
magistrate with regard to his own decisions in
the court below, when heard on appeal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Lord Keeper Henley, till raised to the peerage, used to
complain bitterly of being obliged to put the question for
the reversal of his own decrees, without being permitted to
say a word in support of them.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Lord Eldon, in his Anecdote Book, furnishes another
statement of this case:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When Sir Robert Henley was Keeper of the Great Seal,
and presided in the House of Lords as Lord Keeper, he could
not enter into debate as a Chancellor being a peer does; and
therefore, when there was an appeal from his judgments in
the Court of Chancery, and the law Lords then in the House
moved to reverse his judgments, … the Lord Keeper could
not state the grounds of his opinions given in judgment, and
support his decisions.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And thus for nearly three years this commoner presided.</p>

<p>A few weeks after Henley first took his place as
presiding officer, Franklin arrived in London for the
second time, and continued there, a busy observer, until
after the Judge was created a peer. Even if he had
been ignorant of parliamentary usage, or had forgotten
what passed at the trial of Lord Macclesfield, he could
not have failed to note that the House of Lords had for
its presiding officer an eminent judge, who, not being a
member, could take no part in its proceedings beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
putting the question.</p>

<p>Afterward, in 1770, there was a different arrangement.
Owing to difficulty in finding a proper person
as Chancellor, the Great Seal was put in commission,
and Lord Mansfield, Chief Justice of England, was persuaded
to act as presiding officer. Curiously enough,
Franklin was again in England, on his third visit, and
remained through the service of Lord Mansfield in this
capacity. Thus this illustrious American, afterward a
member of the Convention that framed the National
Constitution, had at two different times seen the House
of Lords with a presiding officer who, not being a member
of the body, could only put the question, and then
again with another presiding officer who, being a member
of the body, could vote and speak, as well as put
the question.</p>

<p>But Franklin was not the only member of the National
Convention to whom these precedents were known.
One or more had been educated at the Temple; others
were accomplished lawyers, familiar with the courts of
the mother country. I have already mentioned that
Blackstone’s Commentaries, where the general rule is
clearly stated, was as well known in the Colonies as in
the mother country. Besides, our fathers were not ignorant
of the history of England, which, down to the
Declaration of Independence, had been their history.
The English law was also theirs. Not a case in its
books which did not belong to them as well as to the
frequenters of Westminster Hall. The State Trials, involving
principles of Constitutional Law, and embodying
these very precedents, were all known. At least
four editions had appeared several years before the
adoption of the National Constitution. I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> err in
supposing that all these were authoritative guides at the
time, and that the National Constitution was fashioned
in all the various lights, historical and judicial, which
they furnished.</p>

<p>The conclusion is irresistible, that the National Constitution,
when providing a presiding officer for the trial
of the President of the United States, used the term
<i>preside</i> in the sense already acquired in Parliamentary
Law, and did not intend any different signification;
that our fathers knew perfectly well the parliamentary
distinction between a presiding officer a member of the
House and a presiding officer not a member; that, in
constituting the Chief Justice presiding officer for a
special temporary purpose, they had in view similar instances
in the mother country, when the Lord Keeper,
Chief Justice, or other judicial personage, had been appointed
to preside over the House of Lords, of which
he was not a member, as our Chief Justice is appointed
to preside over the Senate, of which he is not a member;
that they found in this constantly recurring example
an apt precedent for their guidance; that they
followed this precedent to all intents and purposes,
using received parliamentary language, “the Chief Justice
shall preside,” and nothing more; that, according
to this precedent, they never intended to invest the
Chief Justice, President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate,
with any other powers than those of a presiding officer
not a member of the body; and that these powers,
exemplified in an unbroken series of instances extending
over centuries, under different kings and through
various administrations, were simply to put the question
and to direct generally the conduct of business,
without undertaking in any way, by voice or vote, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
determine any question, preliminary, interlocutory, or
final.</p>

<p>In stating this conclusion I present simply the result
of the authorities. It is not I who speak; it is
the authorities. My own judgment may be imperfect;
but here is a mass of testimony, concurring and
cumulative, without a single exception, which cannot
err.</p>

<p>Plainly and unmistakably, the provision in our Constitution
authorizing the Chief Justice to <i>preside</i> in the
Senate, of which he is not a member, was modelled on
the English original. This, according to the language
of Mr. Wirt, was the “archetype” our fathers followed.
As such it was embodied in the National Constitution,
as if the text expressly declared that the Chief Justice,
when presiding in the Senate, had all the powers accorded
by parliamentary usage to such a functionary
when presiding in the upper House of Parliament without
being a member thereof. In saying that he shall
“preside” the Constitution confers no powers of membership,
and by the well-defined term employed limits
him to those precise functions sanctioned at the time
by immemorial usage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far I have considered this provision in the light
of authorities already known and recognized at the adoption
of the National Constitution. This is enough; for
it is by these authorities that its meaning must be determined.
You cannot reject these without setting at
defiance a fixed rule of interpretation, and resorting instead
to vague inference or mere imagination, quickened,
perhaps, by your desires. Mere imagination and
vague inference, quickened, perhaps, by your desir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>es,
are out of place when Parliamentary Law is beyond all
question.</p>

<p>Pardon me, if I protract this argument by an additional
illustration, derived from our own Congressional
history. This is found under the parallel provision of
the National Constitution relating to the Vice-President,
which, after much debate in another generation,
received authoritative interpretation: “The Vice-President
of the United States shall be <i>President of the Senate</i>,
but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.”
In other words, the Vice-President, like the
Chief Justice, shall <i>preside</i> in the Senate, but, unlike
the Chief Justice, with a casting vote. His general powers
are all implied in the provision that he shall preside.</p>

<p>No question has occurred with regard to the vote of
the Vice-President, for this is expressly regulated by
the National Constitution. But the other powers of
the Vice-President, when presiding in the Senate, are
left to Parliamentary Law and express rules. Some of
the latter were settled at an early day. From the rules
of the Senate at the beginning it appears, that, independent
of his casting vote, nothing was originally recognized
as belonging to a <i>presiding</i> Vice-President beyond
his power to occupy the chair. All else was determined
by the rules. For instance, Senators, when
speaking, are to address the Chair. This rule, which
seems to us so superfluous, was adopted 16th April,
1789, early in the session of the first Congress, in order
to change the existing Parliamentary Law, under which
a member of the upper House of Parliament habitually
addresses his associates, and never the Chair. Down to
this day, in England, a peer rising to speak says, “<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>My
Lords,” and never “My Lord Chancellor,” although the
latter <i>presides</i>. Another rule, adopted at the same date,
has a similar origin. By Parliamentary Law, in the
upper House of Parliament, when two members rise at
the same time, the House, by their cry, indicate who
shall speak. This was set aside by a positive rule of
the Senate that in such a case “the President shall
name the person to speak.” The Parliamentary Law,
that the presiding officer, whether a member or not a
member, shall put the question, was reinforced by an
express rule that “all questions shall be put by the
President of the Senate.”</p>

<p>Although the rules originally provided, that, when a
member is called to order, “the President shall determine
whether he is in order or not,” they failed to declare
by whom the call to order should be made. There
was nothing conferring this power upon the presiding
officer, while by Parliamentary Law in the upper House
of Parliament no presiding officer, <i>as such</i>, could call
to order, whatever he might do as member. The powers
of the presiding officer in the Senate were left in
this uncertainty, but the small number of Senators and
the prevailing courtesy prevented trouble. At last, in
the lapse of time, the number increased, and debates assumed
a more animated character. Meanwhile, in 1825,
Mr. Calhoun became Vice-President. This ingenious
person, severely logical, and enjoying at the time the
confidence of the country to a rare degree, insisted, that,
as presiding officer, he had no power but to carry into
effect the rules adopted by the body, and that therefore,
in the absence of any rule on the subject, he was
not empowered to call a Senator to order for words
spoken in debate. His conclusion was given as fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>lows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Chair had no power beyond the rules of the Senate.
It would stand in the light of a usurper, were it to attempt
to exercise such a power. It was too high a power for the
Chair.… The Chair would never assume any power not
vested in it, but would ever show firmness in exercising
those powers that were vested in the Chair.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The question with regard to the powers of the Chair
was transferred from the Senate Chamber to the public
press, where it was discussed with memorable ability.
An article in the “National Journal,”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> under the signature
of “Patrick Henry,” attributed to John Quincy
Adams, at the time President, assumed that the powers
of the Vice-President, in calling to order, were not derived
from the Senate, but that they came strictly from
the National Constitution itself, which authorizes him
to preside, and that in their exercise the Vice-President
was wholly independent of the Senate. To this
assumption Mr. Calhoun replied in the “National Intelligencer,”
in two articles,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> under the signature of
“Onslow,” where he shows an ability not unworthy of
the eminent parliamentarian whose name he for the
time adopted. The point in issue was not unlike that
now before us. It was insisted, on the one side, that
certain powers were inherent in the Vice-President as
presiding officer, precisely as it is now insisted that
certain powers are inherent in the Chief-Justice when
he becomes presiding officer. Mr. Calhoun replied in
words applicable to the present occasion:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I affirm, that, as a presiding officer, the Vice-President
has no inherent power whatever, unless that of doing what
the Senate may prescribe by its rules be such a power.
There are, indeed, inherent powers; but they are in the <i>body</i>,
and not in the <i>officer</i>. He is a mere agent to execute the
will of the former. He can exercise no power which he does
not hold by delegation, either express or implied.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again, in reply to an illustration that had been
employed, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is not the least analogy between the rights and
duties of a judge and those of a presiding officer in a deliberative
assembly. The analogy is altogether the other way.
It is between the Court and the House.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It would be difficult to answer this reasoning. Unless
all the precedents, in unbroken series, are set aside,
a presiding officer not a member of the Senate has no
inherent power except to occupy the Chair and to put
the question. All else must be derived from grant in
the Constitution or in the rules of the body. In the
absence of any such grant, we must be contented to
observe the mandates of the <i>Lex Parliamentaria</i>. The
objections of Mr. Calhoun brought to light the feeble
powers of our presiding officer, and a remedy was forthwith
applied by amendment of the rules, making it his
duty to call to order. To his general power as presiding
officer was superadded, by express rule, a further
power not existing by Parliamentary Law; and such is
the rule of the Senate at this day.</p>

<p>I turn away from this Vice-Presidential episode, contenting
myself with reminding you how clearly it shows,
that, independently of the rules of the Senate, the presiding
officer <i>as such</i> had small powers; that he could
do very little more than put the question and direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the Secretary; and, in short, that our fathers, in the
interpretation of his powers, had tacitly recognized the
time-honored and prevailing usage of Parliament, which
in itself is a commanding law. But a Chief Justice,
when presiding in the Senate, is not less under this
commanding law than the Vice-President.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far I have confined myself to the Parliamentary
Law governing the upper House of Parliament and
of Congress. Further illustration is found in the position
of the Speaker, whether in the House of Commons
or the House of Representatives. One cardinal distinction
is to be noted at the outset, by which, in both
countries, he is distinguished from the presiding officer
of the upper House: the Speaker is always a member
of the House. As a member he has a constituency
which is represented through him; and here is another
difference. The presiding officer of the upper House
has no constituency; therefore his only duty is <i>to preside</i>,
unless some other function be superadded by the
National Constitution or the rules of the body.</p>

<p>All the authorities make the Speaker merely the organ
of the House, except so far as his representative
capacity is recognized. In the Commons he can vote
only when the House is equally divided; in our House
of Representatives his name is sometimes called, although
there is no tie; but in each case he votes in
his representative capacity, and not as Speaker. In the
time of Queen Elizabeth it was insisted, that, because
he was “one out of our own number, and <i>not a stranger</i>,
therefore he hath a voice.” But Sir Walter Raleigh replied,
that the Speaker “was foreclosed of his voice <i>by
taking that place</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The latter opinion, which has <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>been
since overruled, attests the disposition at that early day
to limit his powers.</p>

<p>Cushing, in his elaborate work, brings together numerous
illustrations, and gives the essence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The presiding officer, though entitled on all occasions to
be treated with the greatest attention and respect by the individual
members, because the power and dignity and honor
of the assembly are officially embodied in his person, is yet
but the servant of the House to declare its will and to obey
implicitly all its commands.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>“The duties of a presiding officer are of such a nature,
and require him to possess so entirely and exclusively the
confidence of the assembly, that, with certain exceptions,
which will presently be mentioned, he is not allowed to exercise
any other functions than those which properly belong
to his office; <i>that is to say, he is excluded from submitting
propositions to the assembly, from participating in its deliberations,
and from voting</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At an early day an English Speaker vividly characterized
his relations to the House, when he describes
himself as “one of themselves to be the mouth, indeed
the servant, of all the rest.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> This character appears
in the memorable incident, when King Charles in his
madness entered the Commons, and, going directly to
the Speaker, asked for the five members he wished
to arrest. Speaker Lenthall answered in ready words,
revealing the function of the presiding officer: “May
it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor
tongue to speak, <i>in this place</i>, but as the House is
pleased to direct me, whose servant I am <i>here</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> This
reply was as good in law as in patriotism. Different
words were employed by Sir William Scott, afterward
Lord Stowell, when, in 1802, on moving the election of
Mr. Speaker Abbot, he declared that a Speaker must
add “to a jealous affection for the privileges of the
House an awful sense of its duties.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But the early
Speaker and the great Judge did not differ. Both attest
that the Speaker, when in the Chair, is only the organ
of the House, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Passing from the Speaker to the Clerk, we find still
another illustration, showing that the word <i>preside</i>, under
which the Chief Justice derives all his powers, has
received an authoritative interpretation in the rules of
the House of Representatives, and the commentaries
thereon. I cite from Barclay’s Digest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Under the authority contained in the Manual, and the
usage of the House, the Clerk <i>presided</i> over its deliberations
while there was no Speaker, but simply put questions,
and, where specially authorized, preserved order, not, however,
undertaking to decide questions of order.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In another place, after stating that in several Congresses
there was a failure to elect a Speaker for several
days, that in the twenty-sixth Congress there was
a failure for eleven days, that in the thirty-first Congress
there was a failure for nearly a month, that in
the thirty-fourth and thirty-sixth Congresses respectively
there was a failure for not less than two months,
the author says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the three last-named periods, while the House
was without a Speaker, the Clerk <i>presided</i> over its deliberations;
not, however, exercising the functions of Speaker
to the extent of deciding questions of order, but, as in the
case of other questions, putting them to the House for its
decision.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This limited power of the Clerk is described in a
marginal note of the author,&mdash;“Clerk <i>presides</i>.” The
author then proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To relieve future Houses of some of the difficulties which
grew out of the very limited power of the Clerk as <i>a presiding
officer</i>, the House of the thirty-sixth Congress adopted the
present 146th and 147th rules, which provide, that, ‘pending
the election of a Speaker, the Clerk shall preserve order and
decorum, and shall decide all questions of order that may
arise, subject to appeal to the House.’”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From this impartial statement we have a practical
definition of the word <i>preside</i>. It is difficult to see
how it can have a different signification in the National
Constitution. The word is the same in the two
cases, and it must have substantially the same meaning,
whether it concern a Clerk or a Chief Justice. Nobody
ever supposed that a <i>presiding</i> Clerk could rule or
vote. Can a <i>presiding</i> Chief Justice?</p>

<p>The claim of a presiding Chief Justice becomes still
more questionable when it is considered how positively
the Constitution declares that “the Senate shall have
the <i>sole</i> power to try all impeachments,” and, still further,
that conviction can be only by “the concurrence
of two thirds of <i>the members present</i>.” These two provisions
accord powers to <i>the Senate solely</i>. If a presiding
Chief Justice can rule or vote, the Senate has not
“the sole power to try”; for ruling and voting, even
on interlocutory questions, may determine the tria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>l. A
vote to postpone, to withdraw, even to adjourn, might,
under peculiar circumstances, exercise a decisive influence.
A vote for a protracted adjournment might defeat
the trial. Notoriously such votes are among the
devices of parliamentary opposition. In doing anything
like this, a presiding Chief Justice makes himself
<i>a trier</i>, and, if he votes on the final judgment, he
makes himself <i>a member of the Senate</i>. But he cannot
be either.</p>

<p>It is only a casting vote that thus far the presiding
Chief Justice has assumed to give. But he has the
same power to vote always as to vote when the Senate
is equally divided. No such power in either case is
found in the National Constitution or in Parliamentary
Law. By the National Constitution he presides, and
nothing more, while by Parliamentary Law there is no
casting vote where the presiding officer is not a member
of the body. Nor does there seem to be any difference
between a casting vote on an interlocutory question
and a casting vote on the final question. The
former is determined by a majority, and the latter by
two thirds; but it has been decided in our country,
that, “if the assembly, on a division, stands exactly one
third to two thirds, there is then occasion for the giving
of a casting vote, because the presiding officer can
then, by giving his vote, decide the question either
way.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> This statement reveals still further how inconsistent
is the claim of the presiding Chief Justice
with the positive requirement of the National Constitution.</p>

<p>I would not keep out of sight any consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
which seems in any quarter to throw light on this
claim; and therefore I take time to mention an analogy
which has been invoked. The exceptional provision
in the Constitution, under which the Vice-President
has a casting vote on ordinary occasions, is taken
from its place in another clause and applied to the
Chief Justice. It is gravely argued that the Chief Justice
is a substitute for the Vice-President, and, as the
latter, by express grant, has a casting vote on ordinary
occasions, therefore the Chief Justice has such when
presiding on an impeachment. To this argument there
are two obvious objections: first, there is no language
giving a casting vote to the Chief Justice, and, in the
absence of express grant, it is impossible to imply it
in opposition to the prevailing rule of Parliamentary
Law; and, secondly, it is by no means clear that the
Vice-President has a casting vote, when called to preside
on an impeachment. On ordinary occasions, in the
business of the Senate, the grant is explicit; but it does
not follow that this grant can be extended to embrace
an impeachment, in face of positive provisions by which
the power to <i>try</i> and <i>vote</i> is confined to <i>Senators</i>. According
to the undoubted rule of interpretation, <i>Ut res
magis valeat quam pereat</i>, the casting vote of the Vice-President
must be subject to this curtailment. Therefore,
if the Chief Justice is regarded as a substitute for
the Vice-President, it will be only to find himself again
within the same limitations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I cannot bring this survey to an end without an expression
of deep regret that I find myself constrained
to differ from the Chief Justice. In faithful fellowship
for long years, we have striven together for the establishment
of Liberty and Equality as the fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
law of this Republic. I know his fidelity, and revere
his services; but not on this account can I hesitate the
less, when I find him claiming in this Chamber an important
power which, in my judgment, is three times
denied in the National Constitution: first, when it is
declared that the Senate alone shall <i>try</i> impeachments;
secondly, when it is declared that only <i>members</i> shall
convict; and, thirdly, when it is declared that the Chief
Justice shall <i>preside</i>, and nothing more,&mdash;thus conferring
upon him those powers only which by Parliamentary
Law belong to a presiding officer not a member of
the body. In the face of such a claim, so entirely without
example, and of such possible consequences, I cannot
be silent. Reluctantly and painfully I offer this
respectful protest.</p>

<p>There is a familiar saying of jurisprudence, that it
is the part of a good judge to amplify his jurisdiction:
<i>Boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem</i>. This maxim,
borrowed from the horn-books, was originally established
for the sake of justice and humanity, that they might
not fail; but it has never been extended to other exercises
of authority. On the contrary, all accepted maxims
are against such assumption in other cases. Never
has it been said that it is the part of a good presiding
officer to amplify his power; and there is at least one
obvious reason: a presiding officer is only an <i>agent</i>, acting
always in presence of his <i>principal</i>. Whatever the
promptings of the present moment, such an amplification
can find no sanction in the National Constitution,
or in that Parliamentary Law from which there is no
appeal.</p>

<p>Thus, w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>hich way soever we turn,&mdash;whether to the
National Constitution, or to Parliamentary Law, as illustrated
in England or the United States,&mdash;we are
brought to conclude that the Chief Justice in the Senate
Chamber is not in any respect Chief Justice, but
only presiding officer; that he has no judicial powers,
or, in other words, powers <i>to try</i>, but only the powers
of a presiding officer not a member of the body. According
to the injunction of the Constitution, he can
<i>preside</i>, but this is all, unless other powers are superadded
by concession of the Senate, subject always to
the constitutional limitation that the Senate alone can
<i>try</i>, and, therefore, alone can rule or vote on questions
which enter into the trial. The function of a presiding
officer may be narrow, but it must not be disparaged.
For a succession of generations, great men in the law,
Chancellors and Chief Justices, have not disdained to
discharge it. Out of the long and famous list I mention
one name of surpassing authority: Somers, the illustrious
defender of constitutional liberty, unequalled in
debate as in judgment, exercised this function without
claiming other power. He was satisfied to preside.
Such an example is not unworthy of us. If the present
question could be determined by sentiments of personal
regard, I should gladly say that our Chief Justice
is needed to the Senate more than the Senate is needed
to him. But the National Constitution, which has regulated
the duties of all, leaves us no alternative. We
are the Senate; he is the presiding officer,&mdash;although,
whether in the Court Room or the Senate Chamber, he
is always the most exalted servant of the law. This
character he cannot lose by change of seat. As such
he lends to this historic occasion the dignity of his
presence and the authority of his example. Sitting in
that Chair, he can do much to smooth the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
business, and to fill the Chamber with the spirit of justice.
Under the rules of the Senate, he can become its
organ,&mdash;but nothing more.</p>

<h3>BATTLE WITH SLAVERY.</h3>

<p>This is one of the last great battles with Slavery.
Driven from these legislative chambers, driven from the
field of war, this monstrous power has found refuge in
the Executive Mansion, where, in utter disregard of Constitution
and law, it seeks to exercise its ancient domineering
sway. All this is very plain. Nobody can question
it. Andrew Johnson is the impersonation of the
tyrannical Slave Power. In him it lives again. He is
lineal successor of John C. Calhoun and Jefferson Davis,
and he gathers about him the same supporters. Original
partisans of Slavery, North and South, habitual compromisers
of great principles, maligners of the Declaration
of Independence, politicians without heart, lawyers for
whom a technicality is everything, and a promiscu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ous
company who at every stage of the battle have set their
faces against Equal Rights,&mdash;these are his allies. It is
the old troop of Slavery, with a few recruits, ready as
of old for violence, cunning in device, and heartless in
quibble. With the President at their head, they are
now intrenched in the Executive Mansion.</p>

<p>Not to dislodge them is to leave the country a prey
to a most hateful tyranny. Especially is it to surrender
the Unionists of the Rebel States to violence and
bloodshed. Not a month, not a week, not a day should
be lost. The safety of the Republic requires action at
once. Innocent men must be rescued from sacrifice.</p>

<p>I would not in this judgment depart from the moderation
proper to the occasion; but God forbid, that,
when called to deal with so great an offender, I should
affect a coldness I cannot feel! Slavery has been our
worst enemy, assailing all, murdering our children, filling
our homes with mourning, darkening the land with
tragedy; and now it rears its crest anew, with Andrew
Johnson as its representative. Through him it assumes
once more to rule and impose its cruel law. The
enormity of his conduct is aggravated by his barefaced
treachery. He once declared himself the Moses of the
colored race. Behold him now the Pharaoh! With
such treachery in such a cause there can be no parley.
Every sentiment, every conviction, every vow against
Slavery must be directed against him. Pharaoh is at
the bar of the Senate for judgment.</p>

<p>The formal accusation is founded on recent transgressions,
enumerated in articles of impeachment; but
it is wrong to suppose that this is the whole case. It
is very wrong to try this impeachment merely on these
articles. It is unpardonable to higgle over words and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
phrases, when, for more than two years, the tyrannical
pretensions in evidence before the Senate have been
manifest, as I shall show, in terrible, heart-rending consequences.</p>

<h3>IMPEACHMENT A POLITICAL PROCEEDING.</h3>

<p>Before entering upon the formal accusation instituted
by the House of Representatives of the United
States in their own name and in the name of all the
people thereof, it is important to understand the nature
of the proceeding. And here on the threshold we
encounter the effort of the apologists seeking in every
way to confound this great constitutional trial with an
ordinary case at <i>Nisi Prius</i>, and to win for the criminal
President an Old Bailey acquittal, where on some quibble
the prisoner is allowed to go without day. From
beginning to end this has been painfully apparent, thus
degrading the trial and baffling justice. Point by point
has been pressed, sometimes by counsel and sometimes
even by Senators, leaving the substantial merits untouched,
as if, on a solemn occasion involving the safety
of the Republic, there could be any other question.</p>

<p>The first effort was to call the Senate, sitting for the
trial of impeachment, a Court, and not a Senate. Ordinarily,
names are of little consequence; but it cannot
be doubted that this appellation has been made the
starting-point for technicalities proverbial in courts.
Constantly we have been reminded of what is called
our judicial character, and of the supplementary oath
we have taken, as if a Senator were not always under
oath, and as if other things within the sphere of his duties
were not equally judicial in character. Out of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
plausible assumption has come that fine-spun thread
which lawyers know so well how to weave.</p>

<p>The whole mystification disappears, when we look at
the National Constitution, which in no way speaks of
impeachment as judicial, and in no way speaks of the
Senate as a court. On the contrary, it uses positive
language inconsistent with this assumption and all its
pretended consequences. On this head there can be no
doubt.</p>

<p>By the National Constitution it is expressly provided
that “<i>the judicial power</i> of the United States shall be
vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts
as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,”&mdash;thus
positively excluding the Senate from
any exercise of “the judicial power.” And yet this same
Constitution provides that “the Senate shall have the
sole power to try all impeachments.” In the face of
these plain texts it is impossible not to conclude, that, in
trying impeachments, Senators exercise a function which
is not regarded by the National Constitution as “judicial,”
or, in other words, as subject to the ordinary conditions
of judicial power. Call it senatorial or political, it
is a power by itself, and subject to its own conditions.</p>

<p>Nor can any adverse conclusion be drawn from the
unauthorized designation of “court” which has been
foisted into our proceedings. This term is very expansive,
and sometimes very insignificant. In Europe
it means the household of a prince. In Massachusetts
it is still applied to the Legislature of the State, which
is known as the General Court. If applied to the Senate,
it must be interpreted by the National Constitution,
and cannot be made in any respect a source of
power or a constraint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how this term, which
plays such a part in present pretensions, obtained its
vogue. It does not appear in English impeachments,
although there is reason for it there which is not found
here. From ancient times, Parliament, including both
Houses, has been called a court, and the House of Lords
is known as a court of appeal. The judgment on English
impeachments embraces not merely removal from
office, as under the National Constitution, but also punishment;
and yet it does not appear that the Lords sitting
on impeachments are called a court. They are not
so called in any of the cases, from the first, in 1330,
entitled simply, “Impeachment of Roger Mortimer, Earl
of March, for Treason,” down to the last, in 1806, entitled,
“Trial of the Right Honorable Henry Lord Viscount
Melville, before the Lords’ House of Parliament in
Westminster Hall, for High Crimes and Misdemeanors
whereof he was accused in certain Articles of Impeachment.”
In the historic case of Lord Bacon, we find, at
the first stage, this title, “Proceedings in Parliament
against Francis Bacon Lord Verulam,” and, after the
impeachment was presented, the simple title, “Proceedings
in the House of Lords.” Had this simplicity
been followed among us, there would have been one
source of misunderstanding the less.</p>

<p>There is another provision of the National Constitution
which testifies still further, and, if possible, more
completely. It is the limitation of the judgment in
cases of impeachment, making it political and nothing
else. It is not punishment, but protection to the Republic.
It is confined to removal from office and disqualification;
but, as if aware that this was no punishment,
the National Constitution further provides that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
judgment shall be no impediment to indictment, trial,
judgment, and punishment “according to law.” Thus
again is the distinction declared between an impeachment
and a proceeding “according to law.” The former,
which is political, belongs to the Senate, which is a
political body; the latter, which is judicial, belongs to
the courts, which are judicial bodies. The Senate removes
from office; the courts punish. I am not alone
in drawing this distinction. It is well known to all
who have studied the subject. Early in our history it
was put forth by the distinguished Mr. Bayard, of Delaware,
the father of Senators, in the case of Blount;<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
and it is adopted by no less an authority than our highest
commentator, Judge Story, who was as much disposed
as anybody to amplify the judicial power. In
speaking of this text, he says that impeachment “is
not so much designed to punish an offender as <i>to secure
the State against gross official misdemeanors</i>; it touches
neither his person nor his property, <i>but simply divests
him of his political capacity</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> All this seems forgotten
by certain apologists on the present trial, who, assuming
that impeachment was a proceeding “according
to law,” have treated the Senate to the technicalities of
the law, to say nothing of the law’s delay.</p>

<p>Discerning the true character of impeachment under
the National Constitution, we are constrained to confess
that it is a political proceeding before a political
body with political purposes; that it is founded on political
offences, proper for the consideration of a political
body, and subject to a political judgment only.
Even in cases of treason and bribery, the judgment is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
political, and nothing more. If I were to sum up in
one word the object of impeachment under the National
Constitution, meaning what it has especially in
view, with its practical limitation, I should say <i>expulsion
from office</i>. The present question is, Shall Andrew
Johnson, on the case before the Senate, be expelled
from office?</p>

<p>Expulsion from office is not unknown to our proceedings.
By the National Constitution a Senator may be
expelled with “the concurrence of two thirds,” precisely
as a President may be expelled with “the concurrence
of two thirds.” In each case the same exceptional vote
of two thirds is required. Do not the two illustrate
each other? From the nature of things, they are essentially
similar in character,&mdash;except that on expulsion
of the President the motion is made by the House of
Representatives at the bar of the Senate, while on expulsion
of a Senator the motion is made by a Senator.
How can we require a technicality of proceeding in the
one which is rejected in the other? If the Senate is a
court, bound to judicial forms on the expulsion of the
President, must it not be the same on the expulsion
of a Senator? But nobody attributes to it any such
strictness in the latter case. Numerous precedents attest
how, in dealing with its own members, the Senate
seeks substantial justice without reference to form. In
the case of Blount, which is the first in our history, the
expulsion was on the report of a committee, declaring
him “guilty of a high misdemeanor, entirely inconsistent
with his public trust and duty as a Senator.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> At
least one Senator has been expelled on simple motion.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Others have been expelled without any formal allegati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>on
or formal proof.</p>

<p>According to another provision of the National Constitution,
overriding both cases, “each House may determine
the rules of its proceedings.” The Senate, on the
expulsion of its own members, has already done this,
and set an example of simplicity. But it has the same
power over its rules of proceeding on the expulsion of
the President; and there can be no reason for simplicity
in the one case not equally applicable in the other.
Technicality is as little consonant with the one as with
the other. Each has for its object the public safety. For
this the Senator is expelled; for this, also, the President
is expelled. <i>Salus populi suprema lex.</i> The proceedings
in each case must be in subordination to this rule.</p>

<p>There is one formal difference, under the National
Constitution, between the power to expel a Senator
and the power to expel the President. The power to
expel a Senator is unlimited in terms. The Senate may,
“with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member,”
nothing being said of the offence; whereas the President
can be expelled only for “treason, bribery, or <i>other
high crimes and misdemeanors</i>.” A careful inquiry will
show that under the latter words there is such a latitude
as to leave little difference between the two cases.
This brings us to the question of impeachable offences.</p>

<h3>POLITICAL OFFENCES ARE IMPEACHABLE OFFENCES.</h3>

<p>So much depends on the right understanding of this
proceeding, that, even at the risk of protracting the discussion,
I cannot hesitate to consider this branch of the
subject, although what I have already said may render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
it superfluous. What are impeachable offences has been
much considered in this trial, and sometimes with very
little appreciation of the question. Next to the mystification
from calling the Senate a court has been that
other mystification from not calling the transgressions
of Andrew Johnson “impeachable offences.”</p>

<p>It is sometimes boldly argued that there can be no
impeachment under the National Constitution, unless
for an offence defined and made indictable by Act of
Congress, and therefore Andrew Johnson must go free,
unless it can be shown that he is such an offender. But
this argument mistakes the Constitution, and also mistakes
the whole theory of impeachment.</p>

<p>It mistakes the Constitution in attributing to it any
such absurd limitation. The argument is this: Because
in the National Constitution there are no Common-Law
crimes, therefore there are no such crimes on which an
impeachment can be maintained. But there are two
answers: first, that the District of Columbia, where the
President resides and exercises his functions, was once
part of Maryland, where the Common Law prevailed;
that, when it came under the national jurisdiction, it
brought with it the whole body of the law of Maryland,
including the Common Law; and that at this day
the Common Law of crimes is still recognized here. But
the second answer is stronger still. By the National
Constitution, <i>expulsion from office</i> is “on impeachment
for and conviction of treason, bribery, <i>or other high
crimes and misdemeanors</i>”; and this, according to another
clause of the Constitution, is “the supreme law
of the land.” Now, when a constitutional provision can
be executed without superadded legislation, it is absurd
to suppose that such legislation is necessary. Here th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>e
provision executes itself without reënactment; and as
for definition of “treason” and “bribery” we resort to
the Common Law, so for definition of “high crimes and
misdemeanors” we resort to the Parliamentary Law and
the instances of impeachment by which it is illustrated.
Thus clearly the whole testimony of English history enters
into this case with its authoritative law. From
the earliest text-writer on this subject<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> we learn the
undefined and expansive character of these offences;
and these instances are in point now. Thus, where a
Lord Chancellor has been thought to put the great seal
to an ignominious treaty, a Lord Admiral to neglect the
safeguard of the seas, an Ambassador to betray his trust,
a Privy Councillor to propound dishonorable measures,
a confidential adviser to obtain exorbitant grants or incompatible
employments, or <i>where any magistrate has
attempted to subvert the fundamental law or introduce
arbitrary power</i>,&mdash;all these are high crimes and misdemeanors,
according to these precedents, by which the
National Constitution must be interpreted. How completely
they cover the charges against Andrew Johnson,
whether in the formal accusation or in the long antecedent
transgressions to which I shall call attention as
an essential part of the case, nobody can question.</p>

<p>Broad as this definition may seem, it is in harmony
with the declared opinions of the best minds that have
been turned in this direction. Of these none so great
as Edmund Burke, who, as manager on the impeachment
of Warren Hastings, excited the admiration of
all by varied stores of knowledge and philosophy, illumined
by the rarest eloquence, marking an epoch of
British history. Thus spoke the greatest genius that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
has ever explained the character of impeachment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is by this tribunal that statesmen who abuse their
power are tried before statesmen and by statesmen, upon
solid principles of State morality. <i>It is here that those who
by an abuse of power have polluted the spirit of all laws can
never hope for the least protection from any of its forms.</i> It
is here that those who have refused to conform themselves
to the protection of law can never hope to escape through
any of its defects.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The value of this testimony is not diminished because
the orator spoke as manager. By professional
license an advocate may state opinions not his own,
but a manager cannot. Appearing for the House of
Representatives and all the people, he speaks with the
responsibility of a judge, so that his words may be
cited hereafter. Here I but follow the claim of Mr.
Fox.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Therefore the words of Burke are as authoritative
as beautiful.</p>

<p>In different, but most sententious terms, Mr. Hallam,
who is so great a light in constitutional history,
thus exhibits the latitude of impeachment and its comprehensive
grasp:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A minister is answerable for <i>the justice, the honesty, the
utility of all measures</i> emanating from the Crown, <i>as well as
for their legality</i>; and thus the executive administration is,
or ought to be, subordinate, in all great matters of policy, to
the superintendence and virtual control of the two Houses
of Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>us, according to this excellent witness, even failure
in justice, honesty, and utility, as well as in legality,
may be the ground of impeachment; and the Administration
should in all great matters of policy be
subject to the two Houses of Parliament,&mdash;the House
of Commons to impeach, and the House of Lords to
try. Here again the case of Andrew Johnson is provided
for.</p>

<p>Our best American lights are similar, beginning with
the “Federalist” itself, which teaches that impeachment
is for “those offences which proceed from <i>the misconduct
of public men</i>, or, in other words, from the abuse
or violation of some public trust: they are of a nature
which may with peculiar propriety be denominated <i>political</i>,
as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately
to the society itself.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> If ever injuries were
done immediately to society itself, if ever there was
an abuse or violation of public trust, if ever there was
misconduct of a public man, all these are now before
us in the case of Andrew Johnson. The “Federalist”
has been echoed ever since by all who have spoken
with knowledge and without prejudice. First came the
respected commentator, William Rawle, who specifies
among causes of impeachment “the fondness for the
inordinate extension of power,” “the influence of party
and of prejudice,” “the seductions of foreign states,”
“the baser appetite for illegitimate emolument,” and
“the involutions and varieties of vice, too many and too
artful to be anticipated by positive law,” all resulting
in what the commentator says are “not unaptly termed
<i>political offences</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> And thus Rawle unites with the
“Federalist” in stamping upon impeachable offences the
epithet “political.” If in the present case there has
been on the part of Andrew Johnson no base appetite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
for illegitimate emolument and no yielding to foreign
seductions, there has been most notoriously the influence
of party and prejudice, also to an unprecedented
degree an individual extension of power, and an involution
and variety of vice impossible to be anticipated
by positive law,&mdash;all of which, in gross or in detail, is
impeachable. Here it is in gross. Then comes Story,
who, writing with the combined testimony of English
and American history before him, and moved only by
a desire of truth, records his opinion with all the original
emphasis of the “Federalist.” His words are like
a judgment. The process of impeachment, according to
him, is intended to reach “personal misconduct, or gross
neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public
interests, in the discharge of the duties of <i>political
office</i>”; and the commentator adds, that it “is to be
exercised over offences which are committed by public
men in violation of their public trust and duties,” that
“the offences to which it is ordinarily applied are of
a <i>political</i> character,” and that, strictly speaking, “the
power partakes of a <i>political</i> character.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Every word
here is like an ægis for the present case. The later commentator,
Curtis, is, if possible, more explicit even than
Story. According to him, an impeachment “is not
necessarily a trial for crime”; its purposes “lie wholly
beyond the penalties of the statute or the customary
law”; and this commentator does not hesitate to say
that it is a proceeding “to ascertain <i>whether cause exists
for removing a public officer from office</i>”; and he adds,
that such cause of removal “may exist where no offence
against positive law has been committed,&mdash;as where
the individual has, from immorality, or imbecility, <i>or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
maladministration, become unfit to exercise the office</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Here again the power of the Senate over Andrew Johnson
is vindicated so as to make all doubt or question
absurd.</p>

<p>I close this question of impeachable offences by asking
you to consider that all the cases which have occurred
in our history are in conformity with the rule
which so many commentators have announced. The
several trials of Pickering, Chase, Peck, and Humphreys
exhibit its latitude in different forms. Official misconduct,
including in the cases of Chase and Humphreys
offensive utterances, constituted the high crimes and
misdemeanors for which they were respectively arraigned.
These are precedents. Add still further, that
Madison, in debate on the power of removal, at the
very beginning of our Government, said: “I contend
that <i>the wanton removal of meritorious officers</i> would
subject the President to impeachment and removal from
his own high trust.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> But Andrew Johnson, standing
before a crowd, said of meritorious officers that he
would “kick them out,”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and forthwith proceeded to
execute his foul-mouthed menace. How small was all
that Madison imagined, how small was all that was
spread out in the successive impeachments of our history,
if gathered into one case, compared with the terrible
mass now before us!</p>

<p>From all these conc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>urring authorities, English and
American, it is plain that impeachment is a power
broad as the National Constitution itself, and applicable
to the President, Vice-President, and all civil
officers through whom the Republic suffers or is in
any way imperilled. Show me an act of evil example
or influence committed by a President, and I show
you an impeachable offence, great in proportion to the
scale on which it is done, and the consequences menaced.
The Republic must receive no detriment; and
impeachment is a power by which this sovereign rule
is maintained.</p>

<h3>UNTECHNICAL FORM OF PROCEDURE.</h3>

<p>The form of procedure has been noticed in considering
the political character of impeachment; but it
deserves further treatment by itself. Here we meet
the same latitude. It is natural that the trial of political
offences, before a political body, with a political
judgment only, should have less of form than a trial at
Common Law; and yet this obvious distinction is constantly
disregarded. The authorities, whether English
or American, do not leave the question open to doubt.</p>

<p>An impeachment is not a technical proceeding, as
at <i>Nisi Prius</i> or in a county court, where the rigid
rules of the Common Law prevail. On the contrary, it
is a proceeding according to Parliamentary Law, with
rules of its own, unknown in ordinary courts. The
formal statement and reduplication of words, constituting
the stock-in-trade of so many lawyers, are exchanged
for a broader manner, more consistent with
the transactions of actual life. The precision of history
and of common sense is enough, without the
technical precision of an indictment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>From time immemorial there has been a just distinction
between proceedings in Parliament and proceedings
in the ordinary courts of justice, which I
insist shall not be abandoned. The distant reign of
Richard the Second, beyond the misfortunes touching
us so much in Shakespeare, supplies a presiding rule
which has been a pole-star of Constitutional Law; nor
is this in any vague, uncertain language, but in the
most clear and explicit terms, illumined since by great
lights of law.</p>

<p>On what was called an appeal in Parliament, or
impeachment, it has solemnly declared that the Lords
were not of right obliged to proceed according to the
course or rules of the Roman law or according to the
law or usage of any of the inferior courts of Westminster
Hall, but by the law and usage of Parliament,
which was itself a court.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this Parliament [in the 11th year of King Richard
the Second, <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> 1387-88] all the Lords then present, spiritual
as well as temporal, claimed as their franchise that the
weighty matters moved in this Parliament, and which shall
be moved in other Parliaments in future times, touching the
peers of the land, shall be managed, adjudged, and discussed
by the course of Parliament, and in no sort by the Law Civil,
or by the common law of the land, used in the other lower
courts of the kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Commons approved the proceedings, and it has
been remarked, in an important official report, that
“neither then nor ever since have they made any objection
or protestation that the rule laid down by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Lords … ought not to be applied to the impeachments
of commoners as well as peers.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Accordingly
Lord Coke declares, that “all weighty matters in any
Parliament moved concerning the peers of the realm, or
commoners in Parliament assembled, ought to be determined,
and adjudged, and discussed by the course of
the Parliament, and not by the Civil Law, nor yet by
the common laws of this realm used in more inferior
courts.” Then, founding on the precedent of 11th Richard
the Second, he announces, that “judges ought not to
give any opinion of <i>a matter of Parliament</i>, because it is
not to be decided by the common laws, but <i>secundum
legem et consuetudinem Parliamenti</i>”; and he adds, “So
the judges in divers Parliaments have confessed.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>But impeachment is “a matter of Parliament,”
whether in England or in the United States. It was
so at the beginning, and has been ever since.</p>

<p>Even anterior to Richard the Second the same conclusion
was recognized, with illustrative particularity,
as appears by the trial of those who murdered King
Edward the Second, thus commented by an eminent
writer on Criminal Law, who was also an experienced
judge, Foster:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is well known, that, in parliamentary proceedings of
this kind, it is and ever was sufficient that matters appear
with proper light and certainty to a common understanding,
without that <i>minute exactness</i> which is required in
criminal proceedings in Westminster Hall.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>us early was the “minute exactness” of a criminal
court discarded, while the proceedings were adapted
to “a common understanding.” This becomes important,
not only as a true rule of procedure, but as an
answer to some of the apologists, especially the Senator
from West Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Van Winkle</span>], who makes
technicality a rule and essential condition.</p>

<p>Accordingly by law and custom of Parliament we
are to move; and here we meet rules of pleading and
principles of evidence entirely different from those of
the Common Law, but established and fortified by a long
line of precedents. This stands forth in the famous
“Report from the Committee of the House of Commons
appointed to inspect the Lords’ Journals in relation to
their Proceedings on the Trial of Warren Hastings,”
which, beyond its official character, is enhanced as the
production of Edmund Burke.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your Committee do not find that any rules of pleading,
as observed in the inferior courts, have ever obtained in the
proceedings of the High Court of Parliament, in a cause or
matter in which the whole procedure has been within their
original jurisdiction. Nor does your Committee find that
any demurrer or exception, as of false or erroneous pleading,
hath been ever admitted to any impeachment in Parliament,
as not coming within the form of the pleading.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This principle appears in the great trial of Strafford,
16th Charles the First, 1640-41, stated by no less a
person than Pym, on delivering a message of the Commons
reducing the charges to more particularity: “Not
that they are bound by this way of <i>special</i> charge; and
therefore, as they have taken care in their House, upon
protestation, that this shall be no prejudice to bind
them from proceeding <i>upon generals</i> in other cases, and
that they are not to be ruled by proceedings in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
courts, which protestation they have made for preservation
of power of Parliaments, so they desire that the
like care may be had in your Lordships’ House.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In
this broad language is a just rule applicable to the present
case.</p>

<p>The question came to formal judgment on the memorable
trial of the Tory preacher, Sacheverell, March 10,
1709-10, impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors,
on account of two sermons in which he put forth the
doctrines of Non-Resistance and denounced the Revolution
of 1688, by which English liberty was saved. After
argument on both sides, and questions propounded by
the Lords, the judges delivered their opinion <i>seriatim</i>,
that, by the law of England and the constant practice
of Westminster Hall, “the particular words supposed
to be criminal ought to be specified in indictments or
informations.” And yet, in face of this familiar and
indisputable rule of the Common Law, thus pointedly
declared, the Lords solemnly resolved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, by the law and usage of Parliament, in prosecutions
by impeachments for high crimes and misdemeanors,
by writing or speaking, the particular words supposed to
be criminal are not necessary to be expressly specified in
such impeachments.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The respondent, being found guilty, moved in arrest
of judgment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That no entire clause, sentence, or expression, contained
in either of his sermons or dedications, is particularly set
forth in his impeachment, which he has already heard the
judges declare to be necessary in all cases of indictments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
or informations.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Lord Chancellor, denying the motion, communicated
to the respondent the resolution already adopted
after full debate and consideration, and added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So that, in their Lordships’ opinion, the law and usage
of the High Court of Parliament being a part of the law
of the land, and that usage not requiring the words should
be <i>expressly specified</i> in impeachments, the answer of the
judges, which related only to the course used in indictments
and informations, does not in the least affect your case.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And so the judgment was allowed to stand.</p>

<p>The substantial justice of this proceeding is seen,
when it is considered that the whole of the libel had
been read at length, so that the respondent had the
benefit of anything which could be alleged in extenuation
or exculpation, as if the libellous sermons had
been entered <i>verbatim</i>. The Report already cited presents
the practical conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was adjudged sufficient to state the crime generally
in the impeachment. The libels were given in evidence;
and it was not then thought of, that nothing should be
given in evidence which was not specially charged in the
impeachment.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The principle thus solemnly adjudged was ever afterwards
asserted by the managers for the House of Commons
in all its latitude, and with an energy, zeal, and
earnestness proportioned to the magnitude of the interests
involved,&mdash;as appeared conspicuously on the impeachment
for high treason of the Lords who had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
part in the Rebellion of 1715 to bring back the Stuarts.
Lord Wintoun, after conviction, moved in arrest of judgment,
and excepted against the impeachment for error,
on account of the treason not being described with sufficient
certainty,&mdash;the day on which the treason was
committed not having been alleged. The learned counsel,
arguing that Parliamentary Law was part of Common
Law, submitted “whether there is not the same
certainty required in one method of proceeding at the
Common Law as in another.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> To this ingenious presentment,
by which proceedings in Parliament were
brought within the grasp of the Common Law, the able
and distinguished managers replied with resolution, asserting
the supremacy of Parliamentary Law. Walpole,
afterwards the famous Prime Minister, began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Those learned gentlemen seem to forget <i>in what court
they are</i>. They have taken up so much of your Lordships’
time in quoting of authorities and using arguments to show
your Lordships what would quash an indictment in the
courts below, that they seem to forget they are now in a
court of Parliament and on an impeachment of the Commons
of Great Britain.… I hope it will never be allowed
here as a reason, that what quashes an indictment
in the courts below will make insufficient an impeachment
brought by the Commons of Great Britain.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Attorney-General supported Walpole:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I would take notice that we are upon an impeachment,
and not upon an indictment. The courts below have set
forms to themselves, which have prevailed for a long course
of time, and thereby are become the forms by which those
courts are to govern themselves; but it never was thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
that the forms of those courts had any influence on the proceedings
of Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Cowper, a brother of the Lord Chancellor of that
name, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the Commons, in preparing articles of impeachment,
should govern themselves by precedents of indictments, in
my humble opinion they would depart from the ancient,
nay, the constant, usage and practice of Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir William Thomson followed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The precedents in impeachments are not so <i>nice and precise
in form</i> as in the inferior courts.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The judges, in answer to questions propounded, declared
the necessity in indictments of mentioning “a
certain day.” But the Lords, in conformity with ancient
usage, set aside this technical objection, and announced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the impeachment is sufficiently certain in point
of time, according to the forms of impeachments in Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus do authoritative precedents exhibit a usage of
Parliament, or Parliamentary Law, unlike that of the
Common Law, which on trials of impeachment seeks
substantial justice, but is not “nice and precise in
form.” If the proceedings are not absolutely according
to the rule of reason, plainly the technicalities of
the Common Law are out of place. It is enough, if
they are clear to “a common understanding,” without
the “minute exactness” of a criminal court. But t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>his
is according to reason. A mere technicality, much
more a quibble, often efficacious on a demurrer, is a
wretched anachronism, when we are considering a question
of political duty. Especially must this be so under
the genius of republican institutions. The latitude established
in England cannot be curtailed in the United
States, and it becomes more essential in proportion to
the elevation of the proceedings. Ascending into the
region of history, the laws of history cannot be neglected.</p>

<p>Even if the narrow rules and exclusions of the Common
Law could be tolerated on the impeachment of an
inferior functionary, they must be disclaimed on the
trial of a chief magistrate, involving the public safety.
The technicalities of law were invented for protection
against power, not for the immunity of a usurper or
tyrant. When set up for the safeguard of the weak,
they are respectable, but on impeachments they are
intolerable. Here again I cite Edmund Burke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“God forbid that those who cannot defend themselves
upon their merits and their actions may defend themselves
behind those fences and intrenchments that are made to
secure the liberty of the people, that power and the abusers
of power should cover themselves by those things which
were made to secure liberty!”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Never was there a case where this principle was
more applicable than now.</p>

<p>The origin of impeachment in the National Constitution
and contemporary authority vindicate this very
latitude. In this light the proceeding was explained
by the “Federalist,” in words which should be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>a guide
now:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>This can never be tied down by such strict rules</i>, either in
the delineation of the offence by the prosecutors or in the
construction of it by the judges, as in common cases serve to
limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This article was by Alexander Hamilton, writing in
concert with James Madison and John Jay. Thus, by
the highest authority, at the adoption of the National
Constitution, it is declared that impeachment “can
never be tied down by strict rules,” and that this latitude
is applicable to “the delineation of the offence,”
meaning thereby the procedure or pleading, and also
to “the construction of the offence,” in both of which
cases the “discretion” of the Senate is enlarged beyond
that of ordinary courts, and so the ancient Parliamentary
Law is vindicated, and the Senate is recognized
within its sphere.</p>

<h3>RULES OF EVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>From form of procedure I pass to rules of evidence;
and here again the Senate must avoid technicalities,
and not allow any artificial rule to shut out the truth.
It would allow no such thing on the expulsion of a
Senator. How allow it on the expulsion of a President?
On this account I voted to admit all evidence
offered during the trial,&mdash;believing, in the first place,
that it ought to be heard and considered, and, in the
second place, that, even if shut out from this Chamber,
it could not be shut out from the public, or be shut
out from history, both of which must be the ultimate
judges. On the impeachment of Prince Polignac and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
his colleagues of the French Cabinet, in 1830, for signing
the ordinances which cost Charles the Tenth his
throne, some forty witnesses were sworn, without objection,
in a brief space of time, and no testimony was
excluded. An examination of the two volumes entitled
“Procès des Derniers Ministres de Charles X.” confirms
what I say. This example, which commends itself to
the enlightened reason, seems in harmony with declared
principles of Parliamentary Law.</p>

<p>As in pleadings, so in evidence, the Law of Parliament,
and not the Common Law, is the guide of the
Senate. In other courts the rules vary, as on trial by
jury in the King’s Bench depositions are not received,
while in Chancery just the reverse is the case. The
Court of Parliament has its own rules. Here again I
quote the famous Report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No doctrine or rule of law, much less the practice of
any court, ought to have weight or authority in Parliament
further than as such doctrine, rule, or practice is
agreeable to the proceedings in Parliament, or hath received
the sanction of approved precedent there, <i>or is founded on
the immutable principles of substantial justice</i>, without which,
your Committee readily agrees, no practice in any court, high
or low, is proper or fit to be maintained.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The true rule was enunciated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Court of Parliament ought to be open with great
facility to the production of all evidence, except that which
the precedents of Parliament teach them authoritatively to
reject, or which hath no sort of natural aptitude directly
or circumstantially to prove the case.… The Lords ought
<i>to enlarge, and not to contract, the rules of evidence</i>, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to the nature and difficulties of the case.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Its point appears in a single sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To refuse evidence is to refuse to hear the cause.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In striking harmony with this most reasonable conclusion
is the well-known postulate of Jeremy Bentham,
who gave so much thought to the Law of Evidence:
“Evidence is the basis of justice: to exclude evidence
is to exclude justice.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The precedents of impeachment, including the trials
of Strafford, Sacheverell, Macclesfield, and the Rebel
Lords in 1715, and again in 1745, all illustrate the
liberality of the proceedings, while the judgment of
Lord Hardwicke, in concurrence with the rest of the
judges, and with the support of the bar, announced,
that “the judges and sages of the law have laid it
down that there is but <i>one</i> general rule of evidence,&mdash;the
best that the nature of the case will admit.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
And this is the master rule governing all subordinate
rules. In harmony with it is another announced by
Lord Mansfield: “All evidence is according to the subject-matter
to which it is applied.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> These two rules
are expansive, and not narrow,&mdash;liberal, and not exclusive.
They teach us to regard “the nature of the case”
and “the subject-matter.” But the case is an impeachment,
and the subject-matter is misbehavior in high
office. Before us is no common delinquent, whose offence
is against a neighbor, but the Chief Magistrate,
who has done wrong to his country. One has injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
an individual, the other has injured all. Here again
I quote the Report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The abuses stated in our impeachment are not those of
mere individual, natural faculties, but the abuses of civil and
political authority. The offence is that of one who has carried
with him, in the perpetration of his crimes, whether of
violence or of fraud, the whole force of the State.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In such a case there must be a latitude of evidence
commensurate with the arraignment. And thus we are
brought to the principle with which I began.</p>

<p>There are other rules, which it is not too late to profit
by. One relates to the burden of proof, and is calculated
to have a practical bearing. Another relates to
matters of which the Senate will take cognizance without
any special proof, thus importing into the case unquestionable
evidence explaining and aggravating the
transgressions charged.</p>

<p>1. Look carefully at the object of the trial. Primarily
it is for the expulsion of the President from office.
Its motive is not punishment, not vengeance, but the
public safety. Nothing less could justify the ponderous
proceeding. It will be for the criminal courts to
award the punishment due to his offences. The Senate
considers only how the safety of the people, which
is the supreme law, can be best preserved; and to this
end the ordinary rule of evidence is reversed. If on
any point you entertain doubts, the benefit of those
doubts must be given to your country; and this is the
supreme law. When tried on indictment in the criminal
courts, Andrew Johnson may justly claim the benefit
of your doubts; but at the bar of the Senate, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
question of expulsion from office, his vindication must
be in every respect and on each charge beyond a doubt.
He must show that his longer continuance in office is
not inconsistent with the public safety,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">“Or at least so prove it,</div>
<div class="verse">That the probation bear no hinge nor loop</div>
<div class="verse">To hang a doubt on.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Anything short of this is to trifle with the Republic and
its transcendent fortunes.</p>

<p>It is by insisting upon doubts that the apologists of
the President, at the bar and in the Senate, seek to save
him. For myself, I see none such; but assuming that
they exist, then should they be marshalled for our country.
This is not a criminal trial, where the rule prevails.
Better the escape of many guilty than that one
innocent should suffer. This rule, so proper in its
place, is not applicable to a proceeding for expulsion
from office; and who will undertake to say that any
claim of office can be set against the public safety?</p>

<p>In this just rule of evidence I find little more than
time-honored maxims of jurisprudence, requiring interpretation
always in favor of Liberty. Early in the
Common Law we were told that he is to be adjudged
impious and cruel who does not favor Liberty: <i>Impius
et crudelis judicandus est qui Libertati non favet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Blackstone,
whose personal sympathies were with power, is
constrained to confess that “the law is always ready
to catch at anything in favor of Liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> But Liberty
and all else are contained in the public safety;
they depend on the rescue of the country from a Presidential
usurper. Therefore should we now, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
name of the law, “catch at anything” to save the Republic.</p>

<p>2. There is another rule of evidence, which, though of
common acceptance in the courts, has peculiar value in
this case, where it must exercise a decisive influence.
It is this: Courts will take judicial cognizance of certain
matters without any special proof on the trial.
Some of these are of general knowledge, and others
are within the special knowledge of the court. Among
these, according to express decision, are the frame of
government, and the public officers administering it;
the accession of the Chief Executive; the sitting of
Congress, and its usual course of proceeding; the customary
course of travel; the ebbs and flows of the tide;
<i>also whatever ought to be generally known within the
limits of the jurisdiction, including the history of the
country</i>. Besides these matters of general knowledge,
a court will take notice of its own records, the conduct
of its own officers, and whatever passes in its own
presence or under its own eyes. For all this I cite
no authority; it is superfluous. I add a single illustration
from the great English commentator: “If the
contempt be committed in the face of the court, the
offender may be instantly apprehended and imprisoned,
at the discretion of the judges, without any further
proof or examination.”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>If this be the rule of courts, <i>a fortiori</i> it must be
the rule of the Senate on impeachments; for we have
seen, that, when sitting for this purpose, the Senate
enjoys a latitude of its own. Its object is the Public
Safety; and therefore no aid for the arrival at truth
can be rejected, no gate can be closed. But here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a gate opened by the sages of the law, and standing
open always, to the end that justice may not fail.</p>

<p>Applying this rule, it will be seen at once how it
brings before the Senate, without any further evidence,
a long catalogue of crime, affecting the character of the
President beyond all possibility of defence, and serving
to explain the later acts on which the impeachment
is founded. It was in this Chamber, in the face
of the Senate and the ministers of foreign powers, and
surrounded by the gaze of thronged galleries, that Andrew
Johnson exhibited himself in beastly intoxication
while he took his oath of office as Vice-President; and
all that he has done since is of record here. Much
of it appears on our Journals. The rest is in authentic
documents published by the order of the Senate. Never
was record more complete.</p>

<p>Here in the Senate we know officially how he made
himself the attorney of Slavery, the usurper of legislative
power, the violator of law, the patron of rebels,
the helping hand of rebellion, the kicker from
office of good citizens, the open bung-hole of the
Treasury, the architect of the “Whiskey Ring,” the
stumbling-block to all good laws by wanton vetoes
and then by criminal hindrances: all these things are
known here beyond question. To the apologists of the
President, who set up the quibbling objection that they
are not alleged in the Articles of Impeachment, I reply,
that, even if excluded on this account from judgment,
they may be treated as evidence. They are the
reservoir from which to draw, in determining the true
character of the later acts for which the President is
arraigned, and especially the <i>intent</i> by which he was
animated. If these latter were alone, without connecti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>on
with transgressions of the past, they would have
remained unnoticed, impeachment would not have been
ordered. It is because they are a prolongation of that
wickedness under which the country has so long suffered,
and spring from the same bloody fountain, that
they are now presented for judgment. They are not
alone; nor can they be faithfully considered without
drawing upon the past. The story of the god Thor in
Scandinavian mythology is revived, whose drinking-horn
could not be drained by the strongest quaffer,
for it communicated with the vast and inexhaustible
ocean. Andrew Johnson is our god Thor, and these latter
acts for which he stands impeached are the drinking-horn
whose depths are unfathomable.</p>

<h3>OUTLINE OF TRANSGRESSIONS.</h3>

<p>From this review, showing how this proceeding is
political in character, before a political body, and
with a political judgment, being expulsion from office
and nothing more,&mdash;then how the transgressions of
the President, in protracted line, are embraced under
“impeachable offences,”&mdash;then how the form of procedure
is liberated from ordinary technicalities of law,&mdash;and,
lastly, how unquestionable rules of evidence open
the gates to overwhelming testimony,&mdash;I pass to the
consideration of the testimony, and how the present impeachment
became a necessity. I have already called
it one of the last great battles with Slavery. See now
how the battle began.</p>

<p>Slavery in all its pretensions is a defiance of law;
for it can have no law in its support. Whoso becomes
its representative must act accordingly; and this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> the
transcendent crime of Andrew Johnson. For the sake
of Slavery, and to uphold its original supporters in their
endeavors to continue this wrong under another name,
he has set at defiance the National Constitution and
the laws of the land; and he has accompanied this unquestionable
usurpation by brutalities and indecencies
in office without precedent, unless we go back to the
Roman emperor fiddling or the French monarch dancing
among his minions. This usurpation, with its brutalities
and indecencies, became manifest as long ago
as the winter of 1866, when, being President, and
bound by oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend
the Constitution, and to take care that the laws
are faithfully executed, he assumed legislative powers
in the reconstruction of the Rebel States, and, in carrying
forward this usurpation, nullified an Act of Congress,
intended as the corner-stone of Reconstruction, by
virtue of which Rebels are excluded from office under
the National Government, and thereafter, in vindication
of this misconduct, uttered a scandalous speech,
in which he openly charged members of Congress with
being assassins, and mentioned some by name. Plainly
he should have been impeached and expelled at that
early day. The case against him was complete. That
great patriot of English history, Lord Somers, has likened
impeachment to Goliath’s sword hanging in the Temple,
to be taken down only when occasion required;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
but if ever there was occasion for its promptest vengeance,
it was then. Had there been no failure at that
time, we should be now by two years nearer to restoration
of all kinds, whether political or financial. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>So
strong is my conviction of the fatal remissness of the
impeaching body, that I think the Senate would do a
duty in strict harmony with its constitutional place in
the Government, and the analogies of judicial tribunals
so often adduced, if it reprimanded the House of Representatives
for this delay. Of course the Senate could
not originate impeachment. It could not take down the
sword of Goliath. It must wait on the House, as the
court waits on the grand jury. But this waiting has cost
the country more than can be told.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the President proceeded in transgression.
There is nothing of usurpation he has not attempted.
Beginning with assumption of all power in the Rebel
States, he has shrunk from nothing in maintenance of
this unparalleled assumption. This is a plain statement
of fact. Timid at first, he grew bolder and
bolder. He saw too well that his attempt to substitute
himself for Congress in the work of Reconstruction
was sheer usurpation, and therefore, by his Secretary
of State, did not hesitate to announce that “it
must be distinctly understood that the restoration will
be <i>subject to the decision of Congress</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> On two separate
occasions, in July and September, 1865, he confessed
the power of Congress over the subject; but
when Congress came together in December, the confessor
of Congressional power found that he alone had
this great prerogative. According to his new-fangled
theory, Congress had nothing to do but admit the
States with governments instituted through his will
alone. It is difficult to measure the vastness of this
usurpation, involving as it did a general nullifica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>tion.
Strafford was not bolder, when, speaking for Charles
the First, he boasted that “the King’s little finger was
heavier than the loins of the Law”;<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> but these words
helped the proud minister to the scaffold. No monarch,
no despot, no sultan, could claim more than an American
President; for he claimed all. By his edict alone
governments were organized, taxes levied, and even the
franchises of the citizen determined.</p>

<p>Had this assumption of power been incidental, for
the exigency of the moment, as under pressure of war,
and especially to serve human rights, to which before
his elevation the President had professed such vociferous
devotion, it might have been pardoned. It would
have passed into the chapter of unauthorized acts which
a patriot people had condoned. But it was the opposite
in every particular. Beginning and continuing in
usurpation, it was hateful beyond pardon, because it
sacrificed Unionists, white and black, and was in the
interest of the Rebellion, and of Rebels who had been
in arms against their country.</p>

<p>More than one person was appointed provisional governor
who could not take the oath of office required
by Act of Congress. Other persons in the same predicament
were appointed in the revenue service. The
effect of these appointments was disastrous. They were
in the nature of notice to Rebels everywhere, that participation
in the Rebellion was no bar to office. If one of
their number could be appointed governor, if another
could be appointed to a confidential position in the
Treasury Department, there was nobody on the long
list of blood who might not look for preferment. And
thus all offices, from governor to constable, wer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>e handed
over to disloyal scramble. Rebels crawled forth from
their retreats. Men who had hardly ventured to expect
life were candidates for office, and the Rebellion
became strong again. The change was felt in all gradations
of government, in States, counties, towns, and
villages. Rebels found themselves in places of trust,
while true-hearted Unionists, who had watched the
coming of our flag and should have enjoyed its protecting
power, were driven into hiding-places. All this
was under the auspices of Andrew Johnson. It was he
who animated the wicked crew. He was at the head
of the work. Loyalty was persecuted. White and
black, whose only offence was that they had been true
to country, were insulted, abused, murdered. There
was no safety for the loyal man except within the
flash of our bayonets. The story is as authentic as
hideous. More than two thousand murders have been
reported in Texas alone since the surrender of Kirby
Smith. In other States there was like carnival. Property,
person, life, were all in jeopardy. Acts were done
to “make a holiday in Hell.” At New Orleans was a
fearful massacre, worse, considering the age and place,
than that of St. Bartholomew, which darkens a century
of France, or that of Glencoe, which has printed
an ineffaceable stain upon one of the greatest reigns
of English history. All this is directly traced to Andrew
Johnson. The words of bitterness uttered at
another time are justified, while Fire, Famine, and
Slaughter shriek forth,&mdash;</p>

<h3>ACCUMULATION OF IMPEACHABLE OFFENCES.</h3>

<p>This is nothing but the outline, derived from historic
sources <i>which the Senate on this occasion is bound
to recognize</i>. Other acts fall within the picture. The
officers he appointed in defiance of law were paid also
in the same defiance. Millions of property were turned
over without consideration to railroad companies, whose
special recommendation was participation in the Rebellion.
The Freedmen’s Bureau, that sacred charity of
the Republic, was despoiled of its possessions for the
sake of Rebels, to whom their forfeited estates were
given back after they had been vested by law in the
United States. The proceeds of captured and abandoned
property, lodged under law in the National
Treasury, were ravished from their place of deposit and
sacrificed. Rebels were allowed to fill the antechambers
of the Executive Mansion and to enter into the
counsels. The pardoning power was prostituted, and
pardons were issued in lots to suit Rebels, thus grossly
abusing that trust whose discreet exercise is so essential
to the administration of justice. The powers of
the Senate over appointments were trifled with and
disregarded by reappointing persons already rejected,
and by refusing to communicate the names of others
appointed during the recess. The veto power, conferred
by the National Constitution as a remedy for ill-considered
legislation, was turned by him into a weapon
of offence against Congress, and into an instrument to
beat down the just opposition which his usurpation
had aroused. The power of removal, so sparingly exercised
by patriot Presidents, was seized as an engine
of tyranny, and openly employed to maintain his wicked
purposes, by the sacrifice of good citizens who would
not be his tools. Incompetent and dishonest creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
recommended only by their echoes to his voice, were
appointed to office, especially in the collection of the
internal revenue, through whom a new organization,
known as the “Whiskey Ring,” has been able to prevail
over the Government, and to rob the Treasury of
millions, at the cost of tax-paying citizens, whose burdens
are thus increased. Laws enacted by Congress
for the benefit of the colored race, including that great
statute for the establishment of the Freedmen’s Bureau,
and that other great statute for the establishment of
Civil Rights, were first attacked by Presidential veto,
and, when finally passed by requisite majority over the
veto, were treated by him as little better than dead letter,
while he boldly attempted to arrest a Constitutional
Amendment by which the rights of citizens and
the national debt were placed under the guaranty of
irrepealable law. During these successive assumptions,
usurpations, and tyrannies, utterly without precedent in
our history, this deeply guilty man ventured upon public
speeches, each an offence to good morals, where, lost
to all shame, he appealed in coarse words to the coarse
passions of the coarsest people, scattering firebrands of
sedition, inflaming anew the rebel spirit, insulting good
citizens, and, with regard to office-holders, announcing,
in his own characteristic phrase, that he would “kick
them out,”&mdash;the whole succession of speeches being,
from their brutalities and indecencies, in the nature
of a “criminal exposure of his person,” indictable at
Common Law, for which no judgment can be too severe.
Even this revolting transgression has additional
aggravation, when it is considered, that, through these
utterances, the cause of justice was imperilled, and the
accursed demon of civil feud lashed again into vengeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
fury.</p>

<p>All these things, from beginning to end, are plain
facts, recorded in our annals, and known to all. And it
is further recorded in our annals and known to all, that,
through these enormities,&mdash;any one of which is ample
for condemnation, while all together present an aggregation
of crime,&mdash;untold calamities have been brought
upon our country, disturbing business and finance, diminishing
the national revenues, postponing specie payments,
dishonoring the Declaration of Independence in
its grandest truths, arresting the restoration of the
Rebel States, reviving the dying Rebellion, and, instead
of that peace and reconciliation so much longed
for, sowing strife and wrong, whose natural fruit is violence
and blood.</p>

<h3>OPEN DEFIANCE OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>For all these, or any one of them, Andrew Johnson
should have been impeached and expelled from office.
The case required a statement only, not an argument.
Unhappily this was not done. As a petty substitute
for the judgment which should have been pronounced,
and as a bridle on Presidential tyranny in “kicking
out of office,” Congress enacted a law known as the
Tenure-of-Office Act, passed March 2, 1867, over his
veto, by two thirds of both Houses.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> And to prepare
the way for impeachment, by removing scruples of
technicality, its violation was expressly declared a high
misdemeanor.</p>

<p>The Presiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>t began at once to chafe under its restraint.
Recognizing the Act, and following its terms,
he first suspended Mr. Stanton from office, and then, in
anticipation of his restoration by the Senate, made the
attempt to win General Grant into surrender of the department,
so as to oust Mr. Stanton and render restoration
by the Senate ineffectual. Meanwhile Sheridan in
Louisiana, Pope in Alabama, and Sickles in South Carolina,
who, as military commanders, were carrying into
the pacification of these States the energies so brilliantly
displayed in the war, were pursued by the same vindictive
spirit. They were removed by the President,
and Rebellion throughout that whole region clapped its
hands. This was done in the exercise of his power as
Commander-in-Chief. At last, in unappeased rage, he
openly violated the Tenure-of-Office Act, so as to bring
himself under its judgment, by defiant attempt to remove
Mr. Stanton from the War Department without
the consent of the Senate, and the appointment of Lorenzo
Thomas, Adjutant-General of the United States,
as Secretary of War <i>ad interim</i>.</p>

<h3>IMPEACHMENT AT LAST.</h3>

<p>The Grand Inquest of the nation, after sleeping on so
many enormities, was awakened by this open defiance.
The gauntlet was flung into its very chamber, and there
it lay on the floor. The President, who had already
claimed everything for the Executive with impunity,
now rushed into conflict with Congress on the very
ground selected in advance by the latter. The field
was narrow, but sufficient. There was but one thing
for the House of Representatives to do. Andrew Johnson
must be impeached, or the Tenure-of-Office Act
would become a dead letter, while his tyranny would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
receive a letter of license, and impeachment as a remedy
for wrong-doing would be blotted from the Constitution.</p>

<p>Accordingly it was resolved that the offender, whose
crimes had so long escaped judgment, should be impeached.
Once entered upon this work, the House of
Representatives, after setting forth the removal of Mr.
Stanton and the appointment of General Thomas in
violation of law and Constitution, proceeded further to
charge him in different forms with conspiracy wrongfully
to obtain possession of the War Department; also
with attempt to corrupt General Emory, and induce
him to violate an Act of Congress; also with scandalous
speeches, such as no President could be justified in
making; concluding with a general Article setting forth
attempts on his part to prevent the execution of certain
Acts of Congress.</p>

<p>Such is a simple narrative, which brings us to the Articles
of Impeachment. Nothing I have said thus far is
superfluous; for it shows the origin of this proceeding,
and illustrates its moving cause. The Articles themselves
are narrow, if not technical; but they are filled
and broadened by the transgressions of the past, all of
which enter into the present offences. The whole is an
unbroken series, with a common life. As well separate
the Siamese twins as separate the offences charged from
that succession of antecedent crimes with which they
are linked, any one of which is enough for judgment.
The present springs from the past, and can be truly seen
only in its light, which, in this case, is nothing less than
“darkness visible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<h3>ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT.</h3>

<p>In entering upon the discussion of the Articles of
Impeachment, I confess my regret that so great a cause,
on which so much depends, should be presented on
such narrow ground, although I cannot doubt that the
whole past must be taken into consideration in determining
the character of the acts alleged. If there has
been a violation of law and Constitution, the apologists
of the President then insist that all was done with good
intentions. Here it is enough, if we point to the past,
which thus becomes part of the case. But of this hereafter.
It is unnecessary for me to take time in setting
forth the Articles. The abstract is enough. They
will naturally come under review before the close of
the inquiry.</p>

<p>Of the transactions embraced by the Articles, the
removal of Mr. Stanton has unquestionably attracted
most attention, although I cannot doubt that the scandalous
harangues are as justly worthy of condemnation.
But the former has been made the pivot of
the impeachment,&mdash;so much so that the whole case
seems to revolve on this transaction. Therefore I
shall not err, if, following the Articles, I put this foremost.</p>

<p>This transaction may be brought to the touchstone
of the National Constitution, and also of the Tenure-of-Office
Act. But since the allegation of violation of
this Act has been so conspicuous, and this Act may be
regarded as a Congressional interpretation of the power
of removals under the National Constitution, I begin
with the questions arising under it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<h3>TENURE-OF-OFFICE ACT.</h3>

<p>The general object of the Tenure-of-Office Act was to
protect civil officers from removal without the advice
and consent of the Senate; and it was made in express
terms applicable to “every person holding any civil
office to which he has been appointed by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate.” To this provision,
so broad in character, was appended a proviso:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury,
of War, of the Navy, and of the Interior, the Postmaster-General,
and the Attorney-General, shall hold their
offices respectively for and during the term of the President
by whom they may have been appointed and for one month
thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As this general protection from removal without the
advice and consent of the Senate might be productive
of embarrassment during the recess of the Senate, it
was further provided, in a second section, that, during
such recess, any person, except judges of the United
States courts, may be suspended from office by the President
on reasons assigned, which it is made his duty to
report to the Senate within twenty days after its next
meeting, and if the Senate concurs, then the President
may remove the officer and appoint a successor; but if
the Senate does not concur, then the suspended officer
shall forthwith resume his functions.</p>

<p>On this statute two questions arise: first, as to its
constitutionality, and, secondly, as to its application to
Mr. Stanton, so as to protect him from removal without
the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to confess in ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>vance that both
have been already practically settled. The statute was
passed over the veto of the President by two thirds
of both Houses, who thus solemnly united in declaring
its constitutionality. Then came the suspension of
Mr. Stanton, and his restoration to office by a triumphant
vote of the Senate, being no less than thirty-five
to six,&mdash;thus establishing not only the constitutionality
of the statute, but also its protecting application
to Mr. Stanton. And then came the resolution of the
Senate, adopted, after protracted debate, on the 21st
February, by a vote of twenty-eight to six, declaring,
that, under the Constitution and laws of the United
States, the President has no power to remove the Secretary
of War and to designate any other officer to perform
the duties of that office <i>ad interim</i>; thus for the
third time affirming the constitutionality of the statute,
and for the second time its protecting application
to Mr. Stanton. There is no instance in our history
where there has been such a succession of votes, with
such large majorities, declaring the conclusions of the
Senate, and fixing them beyond recall. “Thrice is he
armed that hath his quarrel just”; but the Tenure-of-Office
Act is armed <i>thrice</i>, by the votes of the Senate.
The apologists of the President seem to say of these
solemn votes, “Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed”;
but such a threefold record cannot be treated with levity.</p>

<p>The question of the constitutionality of this statute
complicates itself with the power of removal under the
National Constitution; but I shall not consider the latter
question at this stage. It will naturally present itself
when we consider the power of removal under the
National Constitution, which has been claimed by the
President. For the present I assume the constit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>utionality
of the statute.</p>

<h3>ITS APPLICATION TO MR. STANTON.</h3>

<p>I come at once to the question of the application of
the statute to Mr. Stanton, so as to protect him against
removal without the consent of the Senate. And here
I doubt if any question would have arisen but for the
hasty words of the Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>],
so often quoted in this proceeding.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the Senator from Ohio, when the report
of the Conference Committee of the two Houses
was under discussion, stated that the statute did not
protect Mr. Stanton in his office; but this was the individual
opinion of this eminent Senator, and nothing
more. On hearing it, I cried from my seat, “The Senator
must speak for himself”; for I held the opposite
opinion. It was clear to my mind that the statute was
intended to protect Mr. Stanton, and that it did protect
him. The Senator from Oregon [Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>], who
was Chairman of the Conference Committee and conducted
its deliberations, informs us that there was no
suggestion in committee that the statute did not protect
all of the President’s Cabinet, including, of course,
Mr. Stanton. The debates in the House of Representatives
are the same way. Without holding the scales
to weigh any such conflicting opinions, I rest on the
received rule of law, that they cannot be taken into account
in determining the meaning of the statute. And
here I quote the judgment of the Supreme Court of the
United States, pronounced by Chief Justice Taney:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In expounding this law, <i>the judgment of the Court cannot
in any degree be influenced by the construction placed upon
it by individual members of Congress in the debate which took
place on its passage</i>, nor by the motives or reasons assigned
by them for supporting or opposing amendments that were
offered. The law as it passed is the will of the majority of
both Houses, and the only mode in which that will is spoken
is in the Act itself; and we must gather their intention from
the language there used, comparing it, when any ambiguity
exists, with the laws upon the same subject, <i>and looking, if
necessary, to the public history of the times in which it was
passed</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is obvious to all acquainted with a legislative
body that the rule thus authoritatively declared is the
only one that could be safely applied. The Senate, in
construing the present statute, must follow this rule.
Therefore I repair to the statute, stopping for a moment
to glance at the public history of the times, in
order to understand its object.</p>

<p>We have seen how the President, in carrying forward
his usurpation in the interest of the Rebellion,
trifled with the Senate in regard to appointments, and
abused the traditional power of removal, openly threatening
good citizens in office that he would “kick them
out,” and filling all vacancies, from high to low, with
creatures whose first promise was to sustain his barbarous
policy. I do not stop to portray this outrage,
constituting an impeachable offence, according to the
declared opinion of Mr. Madison,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> one of the strongest
advocates of the Presidential power of removal. Congress,
instead of adopting the remedy suggested by this
father of the Constitution, and expelling the President
by process of impeachment, attempted to wrest from him
the power he was abusing. For this purpose the Tenure-o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>f-Office
Act was passed. It was deemed advisable to
include the Cabinet officers within its protection; but,
considering the intimate relations between them and
the President, a proviso was appended, securing to the
latter the right of choosing them in the first instance.
Its object was, where the President finds himself, on
accession to office, confronted by a hostile Senate, to
assure this right of choice, without obliging him to
keep the Cabinet of his predecessor; and accordingly
it says to him, “Choose your own Cabinet, but expect
to abide by your choice, unless you can obtain the consent
of the Senate to a change.”</p>

<p>Any other conclusion is flat absurdity. It begins by
misconstruing the operative words of the proviso, that
the Cabinet officers “shall hold their offices respectively
for and during the term of the President by whom
they may have been appointed.” On the face there is
no ambiguity here. Only by going outside can any be
found, and this disappears on a brief inquiry. At the
date of the statute Andrew Johnson had been in office
nearly two years. Some of his Cabinet were originally
appointed by President Lincoln; others had been formally
appointed by himself. But all were there equally
by his approval and consent. One may do an act himself,
or make it his own by ratifying it, when done by
another. In law it is equally his act. Andrew Johnson
did not originally appoint Mr. Stanton, Mr. Seward,
or Mr. Welles, but he adopted their appointments; so
that at the passage of the statute they stood on the
same footing as if originally appointed by him. Practically,
and in the sense of the statute, they were appointed
by him. They were a Cabinet of his own
choice, just as much as the Cabinet of his successor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>,
duly appointed, will be of his own choice. If the
statute compels the latter, as it clearly does, to abide
by his choice, it is unreasonable to suppose that it is
not equally obligatory on Andrew Johnson. Otherwise
there is special immunity for the President
whose misconduct rendered it necessary, and Congress
is exhibited as legislating for some future unknown
President, and not for Andrew Johnson, already too
well known.</p>

<p>Even the Presidential apologists do not question that
the members of the Cabinet commissioned by Andrew
Johnson are protected by the statute. How grossly
unreasonable to suppose that Congress intended to
make such a distinction among his Cabinet as to protect
those whose support of his usurpation had gained
the seats they enjoyed, while it exposed to his caprice
a great citizen whose faithful services during the war
had won the gratitude of his country, whose continuance
in office was regarded as an assurance of public
safety, and whose attempted removal has been felt as a
national calamity! Clearly, then, it was the intention
of the statute to protect the whole Cabinet, whether
originally appointed by Andrew Johnson, or originally
appointed by his predecessor and continued by him.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation in saying that no other conclusion
is possible without violence to the statute. I
cannot forget, that, while we are permitted “to open
the law upon doubts,” we are solemnly warned “not to
open doubts upon the law.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> It is Lord Bacon who
gives us this rule, whose obvious meaning is, that, where
doubts do not exist, they should not be invented. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
is only by this forbidden course that any question can
be raised. If we look at the statute in its simplicity,
its twofold object is apparent,&mdash;first, to prohibit removals,
and, secondly, to limit certain terms of service.
The prohibition to remove plainly applies to all;
the limitation of service applies only to members of
the Cabinet. I agree with the excellent Senator from
Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harlan</span>], that this analysis removes all ambiguity.
The pretension that any one of the Cabinet
was left to the unchecked power of the President is
irreconcilable with the concluding words of the proviso,
which declare that they shall be “subject to removal
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,”&mdash;thus
expressly excluding the prerogative of the
President.</p>

<p>Let us push this inquiry still further, by looking more
particularly at the statute reduced to a skeleton, so that
we may see its bones.</p>

<p>1. <i>Every person holding any civil office</i>, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, is entitled to hold
such office until a successor is appointed.</p>

<p>2. If members of the Cabinet, <i>then during the term of
the President by whom they have been appointed</i>, and one
month thereafter, unless sooner removed by consent of
the Senate.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton obviously falls within the general class,
“every person holding any civil office”; and he is entitled
to the full benefit of the provision for their benefit.</p>

<p>As obviously he falls within the sub-class, members
of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Here his rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> are equally clear. It is in the discussions
under this head that the ingenuity of lawyers has
found amplest play, mainly turning upon what is meant
by “term” in the statute. I glance for a moment at
some of these theories.</p>

<p>1. One pretension is, that, the “term” having expired
with the life of President Lincoln, Mr. Stanton is retroactively
legislated out of office on the 15th May,
1865. As this is a penal statute, this construction
makes it <i>ex post facto</i>, and therefore unconstitutional.
It also makes Congress enact the absurdity that Mr.
Stanton had for two years been holding office illegally;
whereas he had been holding under the clearest legal
title, which could no more be altered by legislation
than black could be made white. A construction rendering
the statute at once unconstitutional and absurd
must be rejected.</p>

<p>2. The quibble that would exclude Mr. Stanton from
the protection of the statute, because he was appointed
during the first “term” of President Lincoln, and the
statute does not speak of “terms,” is hardly worthy of
notice. It leads to the same absurd results as follow
from the first supposition, enhanced by increasing the
retroactive effect.</p>

<p>3. Assuming that the statute does not terminate Mr.
Stanton’s right a month after President Lincoln’s death,
it is insisted that it must take effect at the earliest possible
moment, and therefore on its passage. From this
it follows that Mr. Stanton has been illegally in office
since the 2d of March, 1867, and that both he and the
President have been guilty of a violation of law, the
former in exercising the duties of an office to which
he had no right, and the latter for appointing him, or
continuing him in office, without consent of the Senate,
in violation of the Constitution and the statute in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
question. This is another absurdity to be rejected.</p>

<p>Assuming, as is easy, that it is President Lincoln’s
“term,” we have the better theory, that it did not expire
with his life, but continues until the 4th of March,
1869, in which event Mr. Stanton is clearly entitled to
hold until a month thereafter. This construction is entirely
reasonable, and in harmony with the Constitution,
and the legislation under it. I confess that it is one to
which I have often inclined.</p>

<p>This brings me back to the construction with which I
began, and I find Andrew Johnson the President who
appointed Mr. Stanton. To make this simple, it is only
necessary to read “chosen” for “appointed” in the statute,&mdash;or,
if you please, consider the continuance of Mr.
Stanton in office, with the concurrence of the President,
as a practical appointment, or equivalent thereto. Clearly
Mr. Stanton was in office, when the statute passed, from
the “choice” of the President. Otherwise he would
have been removed. His continuance was like another
commission. This carries out the intention of the framers
of the statute, violates no sound canon of construction,
and is entirely reasonable in every respect. Or, if
preferred, we may consider the “term” that of President
Lincoln, and then Mr. Stanton would be protected in
office until one month after the 4th of March next.
But whether the “term” be of Andrew Johnson or
President Lincoln, he is equally protected.</p>

<p>Great efforts have been made to show that Mr. Stanton
does not come within the special protection of the
proviso, without considering the irresistible consequence
that he is then within the general protection of the statute,
being “a person holding a civil office.” Turn him
out of the proviso and he falls into the statute, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
you are as imaginative as one of the apologists, who
placed him in a sort of intermediate limbo, like a lost
spirit floating in space, as in one of Flaxman’s Illustrations
of Dante. But the imagination of this conception
cannot make us insensible to its surpassing
absurdity. It is utterly unreasonable, and every construction
must be rejected which is inconsistent with
common sense.</p>

<h3>SUSPENSION OF MR. STANTON RECOGNIZED HIM AS PROTECTED
BY THE STATUTE.</h3>

<p>Here I might close this part of the case; but there is
another illustration. In suspending Mr. Stanton from
office, as long ago as August, the President himself recognized
that he was protected by the statute. The facts
are familiar. The President, in formal words, undertook
to say that the suspension was by virtue of the Constitution;
but this was a dishonest pretext, in harmony
with so much in his career. Whatever he may say, his
acts speak louder than his words. In notice of the suspension
to the Secretary of the Treasury, and then again
in a message to the Senate assigning his reasons for the
suspension, both being according to requirements of the
statute, he testified, that, in his judgment at that time,
Mr. Stanton came within its protection. If not, why
thus elaborately comply with its requirements? Why
the notice to the Secretary of the Treasury? Why the
message to the Senate? All this was novel and without
example. Why write to General Grant of “being
sustained” by the Senate? Approval or disapproval of
the Senate could make no difference in the exercise of
the power he now sets up. Approval could not confirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the suspension; disapproval could not restore the suspended
Secretary of War. In fine, why suspend at all?
Why exercise the power of suspension, when the President
sets up the power of removal? If Mr. Stanton was
unfit for office and a thorn in his side, why not remove
him at once? Why resort to this long and untried experiment
merely to remove at last? There is but one
answer. Beyond all question the President thought Mr.
Stanton protected by the statute, and sought to remove
him according to its provisions, beginning, therefore,
with his suspension. Failing in this, he undertook to
remove him in contravention of the statute, relying in
justification on his pretension to judge of its constitutionality,
or the pusillanimity of Congress, or something
else “to turn up,” which should render justification unnecessary.</p>

<p>Clearly the suspension was made under the Tenure-of-Office
Act, and can be justified in no other way. From
this conclusion the following dilemma results: If Mr.
Stanton was within the statute, by what right was he
removed? If he was not, by what right was he suspended?
The President may choose his horn. Either
will be sufficient to convict.</p>

<p>I should not proceed further under this head but for
the new device which makes its appearance under the
auspices of the Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>],
who tells us, that, “whether Mr. Stanton came under the
first section of the statute or not, the President had a
clear right to suspend him under the second.” Thus a
statute intended as a bridle on the President gives the
power to suspend Mr. Stanton, but fails to give him any
protection. This statement would seem enough. The
invention of the Senator is not less fallacious than th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>e
pretext of the President. It is a device well calculated
to help the President and to hurt Mr. Stanton, with
those who regard devices more than the reason of the
statute and its spirit.</p>

<p>Study the statute in its reason and its spirit, and you
cannot fail to see that the second section was intended
merely as a pendant to the first, and was meant to
apply to the cases included in the first, and none other.
It was a sort of safety-valve, or contrivance to guard
against possible evils from bad men who could not
be removed during the recess of the Senate. There
was no reason to suspend a person who could be removed.
It is absurd to suppose that a President would
resort to a dilatory and roundabout suspension, when
the short cut of removal was open to him. Construing
the statute by this plain reason, its second section
must have precisely the same sphere of operation as the
first. By the letter, Mr. Stanton falls within both; by
the intention, it is the same. It is only by applying to
the first section his own idea of the intention, and by
availing himself of the letter of the second, that the
Senator is able to limit the one and to enlarge the
other, so as to exclude Mr. Stanton from the protection
of the statute, and to include him in the part allowing
suspensions. Applying either letter or spirit
consistently, the case is plain.</p>

<p>I turn for the present from the Tenure-of-Office Act,
insisting that Mr. Stanton is within its protection, and,
being so, that his removal was, under the circumstances,
a high misdemeanor, aggravated by its defiant purpose
and the long series of transgressions which preceded
it, all showing a criminal intent. The apologies of the
President will be considered hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUBSTITUTION OF ADJUTANT-GENERAL THOMAS
AD INTERIM.</h3>

<p>The case of Mr. Stanton has two branches: first, his
removal, and, secondly, the substitution of Adjutant-General
Thomas as Secretary of War <i>ad interim</i>. As
the former was contrary to positive statute, so also was
the latter without support in any Act of Congress. For
the present I content myself with the latter proposition,
without opening the question of Presidential powers
under the National Constitution.</p>

<p>The offender rests his case on the Act of Congress
of February 13, 1795, which empowers the President,
“in case of <i>vacancy</i> in the office of Secretary of State,
Secretary of the Treasury, or of the Secretary of the Department
of War, … whereby they cannot perform the
duties of their said respective offices, … to authorize
any person or persons, at his discretion, to perform the
duties of the said respective offices, until a successor be
appointed, or such vacancy be filled”; and the supply of
the vacancy is limited to six months.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Under this early
statute the President defends himself by insisting that
there was a “vacancy,” when, in fact, there was none.
All this is in that unfailing spirit of prerogative which
is his guide. Here is assumption of power. In fact,
Mr. Stanton was at his office, quietly discharging its
duties, when the President assumed that there was a
“vacancy,” and forthwith sent the valiant Adjutant-General
to enter upon possession. Assumption and
commission were on a par. There is nothing in any
law of the land to sanction either. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> testifies
against the offender.</p>

<p>The hardihood of this proceeding becomes more apparent,
when it is understood that this very statute of
1795, on which the offender relies, was repealed by the
statute of February 20, 1863,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> passed in our own day,
and freshly remembered. The latter statute, by necessary
implication, obliterated the former. Such is the
obvious intention, and I do not hesitate to say that
any other construction leads into those absurdities
which constitute the staple of the Presidential apologists.
The object of Congress was to provide a substitute
for previous statutes, restricting the number of
vacancies which might be filled and the persons who
might fill them. And this was done.</p>

<p>As by the National Constitution all appointments
must be with the advice and consent of the Senate,
therefore any legislation in derogation thereof must be
construed strictly; but the President insists that it
shall be extended, even in face of the constitutional
requirement. To such pretensions is he driven! The
exception recognized by the National Constitution is
only where a vacancy occurs during the recess of the
Senate, when the President is authorized to appoint
until he can obtain the consent of the Senate, and
no longer. Obviously, cases may arise where sudden
accident vacates the office, or where the incumbent is
temporarily disabled. Here was the occasion for an
<i>ad interim</i> appointment, and the repealing statute, embodying
the whole law of the subject, was intended
for such cases,&mdash;securing to the President time to select
a successor, and also power to provide for a temporary
disability. Such is the underlying principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
which it is for us to apply. The expiration of a commission,
which ordinary care can foresee, is not one of
the sudden emergencies for which provision must be
made; and assuming that vacancies by removal were
contemplated, which must be denied, it is plain that
the delay required for the examination of the case
would give time to select a successor, while removal
without cause would never be made until a successor
was ready.</p>

<p>Look now at the actual facts, and you will see how
little they come within the reason of an <i>ad interim</i>
appointment. Evidently the President had resolved
to remove Mr. Stanton last summer. Months elapsed,
leaving his purpose without consummation till February.
All the intervening time was his to select a successor,
being a period longer than the longest fixed
for the duration of an <i>ad interim</i> appointment by the
very statutes under which he professed to act. In
conversation with General Sherman, a month before
the removal, he showed that he was then looking for
a successor <i>ad interim</i>. Why not a permanent successor?
It took him only a day to find Mr. Ewing.
If, as there is reason to suppose, Mr. Ewing was already
selected when Adjutant-General Thomas was
pushed forward, why appoint the latter at all? Why
not, in the usual way, transmit Mr. Ewing’s name as
the successor? For the excellent reason, that the
offender knew the Senate would not confirm him, and
that therefore Mr. Stanton would remain in office;
whereas through an <i>ad interim</i> appointment he might
obtain possession of the War Department, which was
his end and aim. The <i>ad interim</i> appointment of
General Thomas was, therefore, an attempt to obtai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>n
possession of an office without the consent of the Senate,
precisely because the offender knew that he could
not obtain that consent. And all this was under pretext
of an Act of Congress alike in letter and spirit
inapplicable to the case.</p>

<p>Thus does it appear, that, while Mr. Stanton was
removed in violation of the Tenure-of-Office Act, Adjutant-General
Thomas was appointed Secretary of War
<i>ad interim</i> in equal derogation of the Acts of Congress
regulating the subject.</p>

<h3>REMOVAL AND SUBSTITUTION AD INTERIM A VIOLATION
OF THE CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p>It remains to consider if the removal and substitution
were not each in violation of the National Constitution.
The case is new, for never until now could it
arise. Assuming that the Tenure-of-Office Act does not
protect Mr. Stanton, who is thus left afloat in the limbo
between the body of the Act and the proviso, then the
President is remitted to his prerogative under the National
Constitution, and he must be judged accordingly,
independently of statute. Finding the power of removal
there, he may be justified; but not finding it there, he
must bear the consequences. And here the Tenure-of-Office
Act furnishes a living and practical construction
of the National Constitution from which there is no
appeal.</p>

<p>From the Constitution it appears that the power of
appointment is vested in the President and Senate conjointly,
and that nothing is said of the power of removal,
except in case of impeachment, when it is made
by the Senate. Therefore the power of removal is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>not
express, but implied only, and must exist, if at all, as a
necessary consequence of the power to appoint. But in
whom? According to a familiar rule, the power which
makes can unmake. Unless this rule be rejected, the
power of removal must exist in the President and Senate
conjointly; nor is there anything unreasonable in
this conclusion. Removal can always be effected during
the session of the Senate by the nomination and
confirmation of a successor, while provision can be made
for the recess by an Act of Congress. This conclusion
would be irresistible, were the Senate always in session;
but since it is not, and since cases may arise during the
recess requiring the immediate exercise of this power, it
has been argued that at least during the recess it must
be in the President alone. From this position there has
been a jump to the next, and it has been insisted, that,
since, for the sake of public convenience, the power of
removal exists in the President, he is at liberty to exercise
it either during the recess or the session itself.
Here is an obvious extension of the conclusion, which
the premises do not warrant. The reason failing, the
conclusion must fail. <i>Cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa
lex.</i> Especially must this be the case under the National
Constitution. A power founded on implied necessity
must fail when the necessity does not exist. The implication
cannot be carried beyond the reason. Therefore
the power of removal during the recess, doubtful
at best, unless sanctioned by Act of Congress, cannot be
extended to justify the exercise of that power while the
Senate is in session, ready to act conjointly with the
President.</p>

<p>Against th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>is natural conclusion, we have the assumption
that a contrary construction of the National Constitution
was established after debate in 1789. I avoid
all details with regard to this debate, cited and considered
so often. I content myself by asking if at best it
was anything but a Congressional construction of the
National Constitution, and, as such, subject to be set
aside by another voice from the same quarter. It was,
moreover, a Congressional construction adopted during
the administration of Washington, whose personal character
must have influenced opinion largely; and it prevailed
in the House of Representatives only after earnest
debate by a majority of twelve, and in the Senate only
by the casting vote of the Vice-President, John Adams,
who, from position as well as principle, was not inclined
to shear the President of any prerogative. Once
adopted, and no strong necessity for a change occurring,
it was allowed to go unaltered, but not unquestioned.
Jurists like Kent and Story, statesmen like Webster,
Clay, Calhoun, and Benton, recorded themselves adversely,
and it was twice reversed by vote of the Senate.
This was in 1835 and again in 1836, when a bill
passed the Senate, introduced by Mr. Calhoun and sustained
by the ablest statesmen of the time, practically
denying the power of the President.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The Tenure-of-Office
Act was heralded in 1863 by a statute making
the Comptroller of the Currency removable “by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate,”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>&mdash;thus, in
this individual case, asserting for the Senate a check on
the President; and then in 1866, by a more important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
measure, being the provision in the Army Appropriation
Act,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> that “no officer in the military or naval service
shall in time of peace be dismissed from service, except
upon and in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial,”&mdash;thus
putting another check on the President.
Finally, this Congressional construction, born of a casting
vote, and questioned ever since, has been overruled
by another Congressional construction, twice adopted
in both Houses, first by large majorities on the original
passage of the Tenure-of-Office Act, and then by a
vote of two thirds on the final passage of the same Act
over the veto of the President,&mdash;and then again adopted
by more than two thirds of the Senate, when the latter
condemned the removal of Mr. Stanton: and all this
in the light of experience, after ample debate, and with
all the consequences before them. Such a Congressional
construction must have a controlling influence, and
the fact that it reversed the practice of eighty years
and overcame the disposition to stand on the ancient
ways would seem to increase rather than diminish its
weight.</p>

<p>Now mark the consequences. Originally, in 1789,
there was a Congressional construction which in effect
made the National Constitution read,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“The President <i>shall have</i> the power of removal.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">For the next eighty years all removals were made under
this construction. The Tenure-of-Office Act was a new
Congressional construction, overruling the first, and entitled
to equal, if not superior weight. By virtue of this
Congressional construction the National Constitution
now reads,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“The President <i>shall not have</i> the power of removal.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It follows, then, that in removing Mr. Stanton the President
violated the National Constitution as now construed.</p>

<p>The dilemma is this: If the President can remove
Mr. Stanton during the session of the Senate, without
any power by statute, it is only by virtue of a prerogative
vested in him by the National Constitution, which
must necessarily override the Tenure-of-Office Act, as
an unconstitutional effort to abridge it. If, on the other
hand, this Act is constitutional, the prerogative of removal
is not in the President, and he violated the National
Constitution when he assumed to exercise it.</p>

<p>The Tenure-of-Office Act cannot be treated otherwise
than as constitutional,&mdash;certainly not in the Senate,
where some among the apologists of the President voted
for it. Therefore the prerogative of removal is not in
the President. The long practice which grew up under
a mere reading of the National Constitution has been
declared erroneous. To this extent the National Constitution
has been amended, and it is as absurd to plead
the practice under the first reading, in order to justify
an offence under the second, as to plead the existence of
Slavery before the Constitutional Amendment, in order
to justify this monstrosity now.</p>

<p>Thus must we conclude that the offender has violated
not only the Tenure-of-Office Act, but also the
National Constitution; that, even assuming Mr. Stanton
unprotected by the statute, the case is not ended;
that this statute, if construed so as to exclude him,
cannot be rejected as a Congressional construction of
the National Constitution; and that, under this Congr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>essional
construction, which in value is second only
to a Constitutional Amendment, the prerogative of removal
without the consent of the Senate does not
belong to the President. Of course the power of suspension
under the National Constitution, which is only
an incident of the larger pretension, must fall also.
Therefore, in the defiant removal of Mr. Stanton, and
also in the pretended suspension under the National
Constitution with which the transaction began, the
President violated the Constitution, and was guilty of
an impeachable offence.</p>

<p>And so, too, we must conclude, that, in the substitution
of Lorenzo Thomas as Secretary of War <i>ad interim</i>,
the offender violated not only the Acts of Congress
for the supply of vacancies, but also the National
Constitution. Knowing that he could not obtain possession
of the office with the consent of the Senate,
he sought to accomplish this purpose without that
consent. Thus, under color of a statute, he practically
set the National Constitution at defiance. Mark here
the inconsistency. He violates the Tenure-of-Office
Act, alleging that it is against the National Constitution,
whose champion he professes to be, and then
takes advantage of the Acts of Congress for the supply
of vacancies to set aside this Constitution in one
of its most important requirements; for all which he
is justly charged with an impeachable offence.</p>

<p>All this seems clear. Any other conclusion gives
to the President the power under the National Constitution
to vacate all national offices, and leaves the
Republic the wretched victim of tyranny, with a ruler
who is not even a constitutional monarch, but a king
above all laws. It was solemnly alleged in the Charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
against Charles the First of England, that, “being admitted
King of England, and therein trusted with a
limited power <i>to govern by and according to the laws
of the land, and</i> <span class="smcapuc">NOT OTHERWISE</span>,” he nevertheless undertook
“<i>to rule according to his will</i>, and to overthrow
the rights and liberties of the people.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> These very
words now declare the crime of Andrew Johnson.</p>

<h3>THE APOLOGIES.</h3>

<p>Here I might close; but the offender has found
apologists, who plead his cause at the bar and in the
Senate. The apologies are a strange compound, enlarging
rather than diminishing the offences proved. There
is, first, the Apology of Good Intentions; next, the Apology
of making a case for the Supreme Court, being the
Moot-Court Apology; and then, the Apology that the
President may sit in judgment on the laws, and determine
whether they shall be executed, which I call the
Apology of Prerogative. Following these is a swarm of
technicalities, devices, and quibbles, utterly unworthy
of the Senate, and to be reprobated by all who love
justice.</p>

<h4>THE APOLOGY OF GOOD INTENTIONS.</h4>

<p>I begin with the Apology of Good Intentions. In
the light of all that has occurred, with the volume of
history open before us, with the records of the Senate
in our hands, and with the evidence at the bar not
utterly forgotten, it is inconceivable that such an apology
can be put forward. While making it, the apologist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>s
should be veiled, so that the derisive smile on
their faces may not be observed by the Senate, to
whose simplicity it is addressed. It is hard to treat
this apology; but it belongs to the case, and therefore
I deal with it.</p>

<p>A mere technical violation of law, with no evil consequences,
and without any claim of title, is followed
by nominal damages only. If a person, without permission,
steps on a field of grass belonging to another,
he is a trespasser, and the law furnishes a familiar
proceeding against him; but if he has done this accidentally,
and without any real damage, it would be
hard to pursue him, unless assertion of the title were
thought important. But if the trespasser is an old
offender, who from the beginning has broken fences,
ruined trees, and trampled down the garden, and now
defiantly comes upon the field of grass, insisting upon
absolute ownership, then it is vain to set up the apology
that very little damage is done. The antecedent
transgressions, ending in claim of title, enter into the
present trespass, and make it a question whether the
rightful owner or the trespasser shall hold possession.
Here the rightful owner is the people of the United
States, and the trespasser is Andrew Johnson. Therefore
in the name of the people is he impeached.</p>

<p>This simple illustration opens the whole case. Mere
technical violation of statute or of Constitution, without
antecedents and without consequents, would not justify
impeachment. All of us can recall such, even in the
administration of Abraham Lincoln; and I cannot doubt,
that, since this proceeding began, the Chief Justice violated
the National Constitution when he undertook to
give a casting vote, not being a member of the Senate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
These were accidents, besides being innocuous. From
violation of statute or of Constitution the law ordinarily
infers evil intent, and, where such a case is submitted to
judgment, it throws upon the violator the burden of exculpation.
He must show that his conduct was innocent,&mdash;in
other words, that it was without evil intent,
or claim of title. In the present cause we have the denial
of evil intent, with a claim of title.</p>

<p>The question of intent raised by the offender cannot
be considered narrowly. This is a trial of impeachment,
and not a criminal case in a county court. It is a proceeding
for expulsion from office on account of political
offences, and not a suit at law. When the offender sets
up good intentions, he challenges inquisition, according
to the latitude of such proceeding. The whole past is
unrolled by himself, and he cannot prevent the Senate
from seeing it. By a commanding rule of evidence it is
all before us without further proof. You cannot shut it
out; you cannot refuse to look at it. And yet we have
been seriously told that we must shut out from sight
everything but the technical trespass. It only remains,
that, imitating the ostrich, we should thrust our heads
into the sand, and, not seeing danger, foolishly imagine
it does not exist. This may do at <i>Nisi Prius</i>; it will
not do in the Senate.</p>

<p>To such extent has this ostrich pretension been carried,
that we were solemnly admonished at the bar, and
the paradox has found voice in the Senate, that we must
judge the acts of Andrew Johnson “as if committed by
George Washington.” Here is the paradox in length
and breadth. I deny it. I scout it. On the contrary,
I say that we must judge all these acts as if committed
by Andrew Johnson, and nobody else. In other words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
we must see things as they are. As well insist that an
act of guilt should be judged as the mistake of innocence.
As well argue that the stab of the assassin
should be treated as the cut of the surgeon.</p>

<p>To the Apology of Good Intentions I oppose all that
long unbroken series of transgressions, each with a voice
to drown every pretext of innocence. I would not repeat
what I have already said, but, in presence of this
apology, it is my duty to remind the Senate how the
career of this offender is compounded of falsehood and
usurpation; how, beginning with promises to make treason
odious, he soon installed it in authority; how, from
declared sympathy with Unionists, white and black, he
changed to be their persecutor; how in him are continued
the worst elements of Slavery, an insensibility to
right and a passion for power; how, in this spirit, he
usurped great prerogatives not belonging to him; how,
in the maintenance of this usurpation, he stuck at nothing;
how he violated law; how he abused the pardoning
power; how he prostituted the appointing power;
how he wielded the power of removal to maintain his
tyranny; how he sacrificed the Freedmen’s Bureau, and
lifted up the Whiskey Ring; how he patronized massacre
and bloodshed, and gave a license to the Ku-Klux-Klan;
how, in madness, he entered into conflict with
Congress, contesting its rightful power over the reconstruction
of the Rebel States, and, when Congress would
not succumb to his usurpation, how he thwarted and
vilified it, expectorating foul-mouthed utterances which
are a disgrace to human nature; how he so far triumphed
in his wickedness that in nine States no Union
man is safe and no murderer of a Union man can be
punished; and, lastly,&mdash;for time fails, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> not the
long list of transgressions,&mdash;how he conspired against
the patriot Secretary of War, because he found in that
adamantine character an obstacle to his revolutionary
career. And now, in the face of this terrible and indisputable
record, entering into and filling this impeachment,
I hear a voice saying that we must judge the
acts in question “as if committed by George Washington.”
The statement of this pretension is enough. I
hand it over to the contempt it deserves.</p>

<h4>THE MOOT-COURT APOLOGY.</h4>

<p>Kindred to the Apology of Good Intentions, or, perhaps,
a rib out of its side, is the Moot-Court Apology,
which pretends that the President, in removing Mr.
Stanton, only wished to make a case for the Supreme
Court, and thus submit to this tribunal the constitutionality
of the Tenure-of-Office Act.</p>

<p>By this pretension the Supreme Court is converted
into a moot-court to sit in judgment on Acts of Congress,
and the President becomes what, in the time of
Charles the Second, Lord Keeper Guilford said a good
lawyer must be, “a put-case.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Even assuming, against
evidence, that such was his purpose, it is hard to treat
it without reprobation. The Supreme Court is not
arbiter of Acts of Congress. If this pretension ever
found favor, it was from the partisans of Slavery and
State Rights, who, assured of the sympathy of the Court,
sought in this way to complete an unjust triumph. The
power claimed is tribunitial in character, being nothing
less than a veto. Its nearest parallel in history is
in the ancient Justicia of Aragon, who could set aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
even royal ordinances as unconstitutional. The National
Constitution leaves no doubt as to the proper functions
of the Supreme Court. It may hear and determine “all
cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution,
the laws of the United States, and treaties made under
their authority”; but this is all. Its business is to decide
“cases,”&mdash;not to sit in judgment on Acts of Congress
and issue its tribunitial veto. If a “case” arises
where a statute is said to clash with the National Constitution,
it must be decided as any other case of conflict
of laws. But nothing within the just powers of
the Court can touch an Act of Congress, except incidentally,
and then its judgment is binding only on the
parties. The incidental reason assigned&mdash;as, for instance,
that a statute is unconstitutional&mdash;does not
bind anybody, not even the parties or the Court itself.
Of course such incidental reason cannot bind
Congress.</p>

<p>On the evidence it is clear enough that the President
had no honest purpose to make a case for the
Supreme Court. He may have talked about it, but he
was never in earnest. When asked by General Sherman
“why lawyers could not make a case,” he said,
in reply, “that it was found impossible, or a case could
not be made up.” And so at each stage we find him
practically discarding the idea. He issues the order of
removal. Mr. Stanton disobeys. Here was exactly his
opportunity. Instead of making the case by commencing
the proper process, he tells Adjutant-General Thomas
to “go on and take possession of the office”; and then,
putting an end to this whole pretension of a case for
the Court, he proceeds to treat the latter in every respect,
whether of law or fact, as Secretary, welcomes him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
to his Cabinet, invites him to present the business of
his Department, and, so far from taking advantage of
the opportunity he had professed to desire, denies its
existence. How could he inquire by what authority
Mr. Stanton assumed to hold the office of Secretary
of War, when he denied, in fact, that he was holding
it?</p>

<p>Look a little further, and the reason of this indifference
becomes apparent. The old writ of <i>Quo Warranto</i>
was the only process by which a case could be
made, and this only at the suit of the Attorney-General.
Had the President made an order of removal,
the Secretary would have been compelled to hold only
by virtue of the law and the Constitution. In answer
to the writ he would have pleaded this protection, and
the Court must have decided the validity of the plea.
Meanwhile he would have remained in office. Had he
left, the process would have failed, and there was none
other by which he could raise the question. The decision
of the Supreme Court in <i>Wallace</i> v. <i>Anderson</i><a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
would prevent resort to a <i>Quo Warranto</i> on his part,
while the earlier case of <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i><a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> would
shut him out from a <i>Mandamus</i>. The apologists have
not suggested any other remedy. It is clear, therefore,
that Mr. Stanton’s possession of the office was a
<i>sine qua non</i> to a case in the Supreme Court, and
that this could be only by <i>Quo Warranto</i>. The local
attorney employed by the President testifies that in
such a case judgment could not be reached within a
year. This was enough to render it impracticable;
for, if commenced, it would leave the hated Secretary
at his post for the remainder of the Presidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
term. During the pendency of the proceeding Mr. Stanton
would continue legitimate possessor of the office.
Therefore the commencement of a case would defeat
the Presidential passion for instant removal. True to
his passion, he removed the Secretary, well knowing
that in this way he prevented a case for the Court.</p>

<p>Against this conclusion, where all the testimony is
harmonized, we have certain fruitless conversations
with his Cabinet, and an attempt to raise the question
on <i>Habeas Corpus</i> after the arrest of Adjutant-General
Thomas. Conversations, whose exclusion has
given a handle to the apologists, which they do not
fail to use, only show that the President made this
question a subject of talk, and that, in the end, it became
apparent that he could not make a case so as
to remove Mr. Stanton during his term, and as this
was his darling object, the whole idea was abandoned.
The arrest of Adjutant-General Thomas seemed for a
moment to furnish another chance; but it is enough
to say of the futile attempt at that time, that it was
not only after the removal of Mr. Stanton, but after
impeachment had been voted by the House.</p>

<p>Had the President been in earnest, it was very easy
for him to make a case by proceeding against a simple
postmaster; but this did not suit him. He was in
earnest only to remove Mr. Stanton.</p>

<p>Nothing is clearer than that this Moot-Court Apology
is a wretched pretension and afterthought. It is
the subterfuge of a criminal to cover up his crime,&mdash;as
if a surgeon had committed murder, and then set
up the apology that it was an experiment in science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE APOLOGY OF PREROGATIVE.</h4>

<p>Then comes the Apology of Prerogative, being nothing
less than the intolerable pretension that the President
can sit in judgment on Acts of Congress, and,
in his discretion, refuse to execute them. This apology
is in the nature of a claim of right. Let it be
established, and, instead of a government of laws, which
is the glory of a republic, we have only the government
of a single man. Here is the one-man power
with a vengeance.</p>

<p>Of course, if the President can sit in judgment on
the Tenure-of-Office Act, and set it aside as unconstitutional,
there is no Act of Congress he may not treat
in the same way. He may set aside the whole succession
of statutes for the government of the army;
and his interview with General Emory attests his willingness
to venture in that direction. In the spirit of
oppression which seems to govern him, he may set
aside the great statute for the establishment of civil
rights without distinction of color. But why confine
myself to instances? The whole statute-book will be
subject to his prerogative. Vain the requirement of
the National Constitution, that the President “shall
take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Vain
that other requirement, that a bill approved by two
thirds of both Houses over his veto “shall become a
law.” His veto is perpetual; nor is it limited to any
special enactment. It is as broad as the whole recorded
legislation of the Republic. There is nothing
it cannot hurry into that maelstrom ingulfing all.</p>

<p>The President considers the statute unconstitutional,
say the apologists. A mistake in judgment on such a
question is not an impeachable offence, add the apologists.
To which I reply, that it is not for mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
in judgment, but for usurpation in undertaking to exercise
his judgment at all on such a question, that he
is impeached; in other words, he is impeached for undertaking
to set aside a statute. Whether the statute
is constitutional or not is immaterial. The President,
after the statute has become a law, is not the person
to decide.</p>

<p>Ingenuity seeks to perplex the question by putting
impossible cases. For instance, suppose Congress should
have lost its wits so far as to enact, in direct terms,
that the President should not be commander-in-chief
of the army and navy, or that he should not have the
power to grant pardons; and suppose, still further, that
Congress, in defiance of positive inhibition, should undertake
to create “titles of nobility”; must not the
President treat such enactments as unconstitutional?
Of course he must; but such instances do not help
the prerogative now claimed. Every such enactment
would be on its face unconstitutional. It would be an
act of unreasoning madness, which President as well
as Court must disregard as if plain nonsense. Its unconstitutionality
would be like an axiom, not to be
questioned. No argument or authority is needed. It
proves itself. Nor would the duty of disobedience be
less obligatory, even if the enactment were sanctioned
by the Supreme Court: and it is not more violent for
me to suppose it sanctioned by the Supreme Court
than for the apologists to suppose it sanctioned by
Congress. The enactment would be a self-evident monstrosity,
and therefore to be disobeyed, as if one of the
Ten Commandments were reversed so as to read, “Thou
shalt kill.” Such extreme cases serve no purpose. The
National Constitution is the supreme law of the lan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>d,
and the people will not allow its axiomatic requirements
to be set aside. An illustration outside the
limits of reason is of no value.</p>

<p>In the cases supposed, the unconstitutionally of the
enactment is axiomatic, excluding opinion or argument.
It is matter of fact, and not matter of opinion. When
the case is one on which there are two sides or two
different views, it is then within the domain of argument.
It is in no sense axiomatic. It is no longer
matter of fact, but matter of opinion. When submitted
to the Supreme Court, it is for their “opinion.”
Without occupying time with refinements, I content
myself with asserting that the judgment of the Court
must be matter of opinion. One of the apologists has
asserted that such a judgment is matter of fact, and,
generally, that the constitutionality of a statute is
matter of fact. I assert the contrary. When a bench
of judges stands five to four, shall we say that the
majority declare a “fact,” and the minority declare an
“opinion”?</p>

<p>Assuming, then, what I think will not be denied,
that the constitutionality of a statute is matter of
opinion, the question occurs, What opinion shall be
regarded for the time as decisive? Clearly the opinion
of Congress must control all executive officers, from
the lowest to the President. According to a venerable
maxim of jurisprudence, all public acts are presumed to
be correct,&mdash;<i>Omnia rite acta præsumuntur</i>. A statute
must be presumed constitutional, unless on its face the
contrary; and no decision of any court is required in its
favor. It is the law of the land, and must be obeyed
as such. The maxim which presumes constitutionality
is just as binding as the analogous maxim of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Criminal Law which presumes innocence. The President,
reversing all this, presumes the statute unconstitutional,
and acts accordingly. In the name of
Prerogative he sets it aside.</p>

<p>The apologists have been driven to invoke the authority
of President Jackson, who asserted for himself
the power to judge the constitutionality of an Act of
Congress which in the course of legislation required
his approval, although the question involved had been
already adjudged by the Supreme Court. And he was
clearly right. The Court itself would not be bound
by its adjudication. How could it constrain another
branch of the Government? But Andrew Jackson
never put forth the pretension that it was within his
prerogative to nullify a statute which had been passed
over his veto in the way prescribed by the National
Constitution. He was courageous, but there was no
such unconstitutional audacity in his life.</p>

<p>The apologists also summon to their aid those great
instances where conscientious citizens have refused
obedience to unjust laws. Such was the case of Hampden,
who set an example for all time in refusing to
pay ship-money. Such also was the case of many in
our own country, who spurned the Fugitive Slave Bill.
These exalted characters, on their conscience, refused
to obey the law, and suffered accordingly. The early
Christians were required by imperial mandate to strew
grain on the altar of Jove. Though good citizens, they
preferred to be martyrs. Such a refusal can be no apology
for a President, who, in the name of prerogative,
breaks the great oath to see that the laws are faithfully
executed. Rather do these instances, in their
moral grandeur, rebuke the offender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>Here I turn from this Apology of Prerogative, regretting
that I cannot say more to unfold its destructive
character. If anything could aggravate the transgressions
of Andrew Johnson, stretching in long line
from the beginning of his administration, it would be
the claim of right he sets up, under which the slenderest
violation of law becomes a high crime and misdemeanor,
to be pursued and judged by an indignant
people. The supremacy of the laws must be preserved,
or the liberties of all will suffer.</p>

<h3>TECHNICALITIES AND QUIBBLES.</h3>

<p>I now come upon that swarm of technicalities, devices,
quirks, and quibbles, which from the beginning
have infested this proceeding. It is hard to speak of
such things without showing a contempt not entirely
parliamentary. To say that they are petty and miserable
is not enough. To say that they are utterly unworthy
of this historic occasion is to treat them politely.
They are nothing but parasitic insects, “vermin
gendered in a lion’s mane,”&mdash;so nimble and numerous,
that, to deal with them as they skip about, one must
have the patience of the Italian peasant, who catches
and kills, one by one, the diminutive animals that infest
his person. The public has not forgotten the exhibition
of “industrious fleas.” The Senate has witnessed
the kindred exhibition of “industrious quibbles.”</p>

<p>I can give specimens only, and out of many I take
one which can never be forgotten. It is found in the
Opinion of the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Van
Winkle</span>], which, from beginning to end, treats this impeachment
as if it were a prosecution for sheep-stealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
in the police-court of Wheeling, and brings to the
defence the unhesitating resources of a well-trained
criminal lawyer. This famous Opinion, which is without
parallel in the annals of jurisprudence, must always
be admired as the marvel of technicality in a
proceeding where technicality should not intrude. It
stands by itself, solitary in originality. Others have
been technical also, but the Senator from West Virginia
is nothing else. Travelling from point to point,
or rather seeing point after point skip before him, at
last he lights upon one of the largest dimensions, which
he boldly seizes and presents to the Senate.</p>

<p>According to him, there is no allegation in the Articles
that the order for the removal of Mr. Stanton was
actually delivered to him, and, this being so, the Senator
declares, that, “if there is evidence of a delivery
to be found in the proceedings, it cannot be applicable
to this Article, in which there is no charge or averment.”
And this is gravely uttered on this transcendent
occasion, when an indignant people has risen to
demand judgment of a criminal ruler. The Article
alleges that the order was “unlawfully issued,” and
nobody doubts that its delivery was proved; but this
is not enough, according to the Senator. I challenge
history for another instance of equal absurdity in legal
pretension. The case approaching it the closest is the
famous extravagance of the Crown lawyer in the British
Parliament, who, in reply to the argument of our
fathers that they could not be taxed without representation,
bravely insisted that they were represented,
and sustained himself by declaring, that, under the
Colonial charters, the lands were held in common socage
as “of the manor of Greenwich in Kent,” and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
as Greenwich was represented in Parliament, therefore
the Colonies were represented there.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The pretension
was perfect in form, but essentially absurd. The Senator
from West Virginia outdoes even this climax of
technicality. Other generations, as they read this great
trial, with its accumulation of transgressions ending in
the removal of Mr. Stanton, will note with wonder
that a principal reason assigned for the verdict of Not
Guilty was the failure of the Articles to allege that the
order for removal was actually received, although there
was a distinct allegation that it was “unlawfully issued,”
with evidence that it was received, and no human
being, not even the technical Senator, imagined that it
was not. But how inconsistent with the Law of Impeachment
already set forth,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> which seeks substantial
justice, and will not be arrested by any nice requirements!
Lord Mansfield did not hesitate to condemn
certain objections as “disgraceful subtilties.” What
would he have said to the Senator from West Virginia?</p>

<p>There is another invention, which has in its support
some of the ablest of the apologists, like the
Senator from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>], the Senator from
Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>], and the Senator from Illinois
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>]. It is said, that, as Mr. Stanton
did not go out, therefore there was no removal, and
therefore Andrew Johnson is not guilty. If the authority
of names could change the unreal into the real,
then this pretension might have weight. It is impossible
that anything so essentially frivolous should b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>e
recognized in this proceeding. Such are the shifts of
a cause to be defended only by shifts! Clearly the
offence of the President was in the order “unlawfully
issued,” and this was complete at the moment of its
delivery. So far as depended upon him, Mr. Stanton
was removed. This is the way in which the country
saw the transaction, and the way also in which it will
be recorded by history.</p>

<p>But these same apologists, with curious inconsistency,
when they come to consider the appointment of
Adjutant-General Thomas, insist that there was vacancy
in law, called by the Senator from Maine <i>legal</i>
vacancy. But such vacancy could be only because
there had been removal in law. There is no escape
from this consequence. If there was removal in law,
and there was no right to make it, the President was
guilty of misdemeanor in law, and must take the consequences.</p>

<p>It would be unprofitable to follow these inventions
further. From these know all. In the face of Presidential
pretensions inconsistent with constitutional liberty,
the apologists have contributed their efforts to
save the criminal by subtilties which can secure his
acquittal in form only, as by a flaw in an indictment;
and they have done this, knowing that he will be left
in power to assert his prerogative, and that his acquittal
will be a new letter of license. Nothing the skill
of the lawyer could supply has been wanting. This
learned profession lends to the criminal all the arts
in which it excels, giving all to him and forgetting
the Republic. Every doubt, every scruple, every technicality,
every subtilty, every quibble, is arrayed on his
side, when, by every rule of reason and patriotism, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
should be arrayed on the side of our country. The
Public Safety, which is the supreme law, is now imperilled.
Are we not told by Blackstone that “the
law is always ready to catch at anything in favor of
Liberty”?<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> But these apologists catch at anything to
save a usurper. In the early days of the Common Law
there were technicalities in abundance, but they were
for the maintenance of justice. On such was founded
that extensive <i>ac etiam</i> jurisdiction of the King’s
Bench, which gives occasion for the elegant Commentator
to remark, that, however startling these may be
at first to the student, “he will find them, upon further
consideration, to be highly beneficial and useful.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
These generous fictions for the sake of justice must
not be confounded with the devices by which justice
is defeated.</p>

<p>The trick of the apologists has been, by stringent
application of technical rules, to shut out all except
offences charged, and then, when stress was laid upon
these offences, to cry out that at most they were only
technical, and too trifling for impeachment. To satisfy
lawyers, the House weakly declined to act on the
bloody transgressions of two years, but sought to provide
against the future. Like the Roman ambassadors,
they traced a line about the offender, which he was not
to pass except at peril. This was the line of law. At
last he passed the line, openly, knowingly, defiantly;
and now that he is arraigned, we are told that this
plain offence is nothing, only a little technicality. One
of the counsel at the bar, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Groesbeck</span>,] in a speech
which showed how much feeling and talent could be
given to a wrong side, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It almost shocks me to think that the President of the
United States is to be dragged out of his office on these miserable
little questions whether he could make an <i>ad interim</i>
appointment for a single day.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Only by excluding the whole context and all its antecedents
could the question be reduced to this trivial
form; and yet, even thus reduced, it involved nothing
less than the supremacy of the laws.</p>

<p>I know not how such a question can be called
“trifling.” Often a great cause is presented on a narrow
issue: as when English liberty was argued on
the claim of ship-money, which was a tax of a few
shillings only. Behind this question, called trifling by
the kingly apologists of that day, loftily stood the great
cause of the People against Prerogative, being the same
now pending before the Senate. That other cause, on
which at a later day hung the destinies of this continent,
was presented on a narrower issue still. There
was a tax of threepence a pound on tea, which our
fathers refused to pay. But behind this question, so
trifling to the apologists of prerogative, as behind that
of ship-money, stood loftily the same great cause. The
first cost Charles the First his head. The second cost
George the Third his colonies. If such a question can
be disparaged as of small moment, then have the martyred
dead in all times suffered in vain, then was the
costly blood lavished for the suppression of our Rebellion
an empty sacrifice.</p>

<p>Constantly we are admonished that we must confine
ourselves to the Articles. Senators express a pious horror
at looking outside the Articles, and insist upon directing
attention to these only. Here the Senator from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Maine is very strong. It is “the specific offences
charged,” and these only, that he sees. He will not
look at anything else, although spread upon the record
of the Senate, and filling the land with accumulated
horrors. Of course such a system of exclusion sacrifices
justice, belittles this trial, and forgets that essential latitude
of inquiry which belongs to a political proceeding,
having for its purpose expulsion from office only,
and not punishment. It is easy, by looking at an object
through the wrong end of an opera-glass, to find
it dwarfed, contracted, and solitary. This is not the
way to look at Nature; nor is it the way to look at
Andrew Johnson. The great offender should be seen
in the light of day, precisely as he is, nor more nor
less, with nothing dwarfed, with no limits to the vision,
and with all the immense background of thronging
transgressions filling the horizon as far as eye can
reach. The sight may ache; but how else can justice
be done? A Senator who begins by turning these
Articles into an inverted opera-glass takes the first step
towards judgment of acquittal. Alas that the words
of Burke are not true, when, asserting the comprehensive
character of impeachment, he denied, that, under it,
“they who have no hope at all in the justice of their
cause can have any hope that by some subtilties of
form, some mode of pleading, by something, in short,
different from the merits of the cause, they may prevail.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
The orator was right in thus indignantly dismissing
all questions of pleading and all subtilties of
form. This proceeding is of substance, and not of form.
It is on the merits only that it can be judged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> Anything
short of this is the sacrifice of justice.</p>

<p>Such is the case of this enormous criminal. Events
belonging to history, enrolled in the records of the Senate,
and familiar to the country, are deliberately shut
out from view, while we are treated to legal niceties
without end. The lawyers have made a painful record.
Nothing ever occurred so much calculated to
bring the profession into disrepute; for never before
has been such a theatre where lawyers were actors.
Their peculiarities have been exhibited. Here was a
great question of justice, appealing to the highest sentiments,
and involving the best interests of the country;
but lawyers, instinctive for the dialectics of the
profession, forgot everlasting truth, never to be forgotten
with impunity. They started at once in full cry,
and the quibble became to them what Dr. Johnson
says it was to the great dramatist: “He follows it at
all adventures; it is sure to lead him out of his way,
and sure to ingulf him in the mire. It has some malignant
power over his mind, and its fascinations are irresistible.…
A quibble is the golden apple for which
he will always turn aside from his career, or stoop from
his elevation. A quibble, poor and barren as it is, gave
him such delight that he was content to purchase it by
the sacrifice of reason, propriety, and truth.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> In this
Shakespearean spirit our lawyers have acted. They have
pursued quibbles with the ardor of the great dramatist,
and even now are chasing them through the Senate
Chamber.</p>

<p>Unhappily this is according to history, and our lawyers
are not among the splendid exceptions. But there
is reward for those who stand firm. Who does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
reverence the exalted magistrate of France, the Chancellor
L’Hospital, who set the great example of rectitude
and perfect justice? Who does not honor those
lawyers of English history through whose toils Liberty
was upheld? There was Selden, so wise and learned;
Pym, so grand in statesmanship; Somers, who did so
much to establish the best securities of the Constitution.
Nor can I forget, at a later day, that greatest
advocate, Erskine, who lent to the oppressed his wonderful
eloquence; nor Mackintosh and Brougham, who
carried into courts that enlarged intelligence and sympathetic
nature which the profession of the law could
not constrain. These are among the names that have
already had their reward, above the artful crowd which
in all times has come to the defence of prerogative.
It is no new thing that we witness now. The lawyer
in other days has been, as we know him, prone to the
support of power, and ready with technical reasons.
Whichever side he takes, he finds reasons plenty as
pins. When free to choose, and not hired, his argument
is the reflection of himself. All that he says is
his own image. He takes sides on a law point according
to his sentiments. Cultured in law, and with aptitude
sharpened by its contests, too easily he finds a
legal reason for an illegal judgment. Next to an outright
mercenary, give me a lawyer to betray a great
cause. Forms of law lend themselves to the betrayal.
It is impossible to forget that the worst pretensions of
prerogative, no matter how colossal, have been shouldered
by lawyers. It was they who carried ship-money
against the patriot exertions of Hampden; and in our
country it was they who held up Slavery in all its
terrible pretensions from beginning to end. What is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
sometimes called “the legal mind” of Massachusetts,
my own honored State, bent before the technical reasoning
which justified the unutterable atrocities of the
Fugitive Slave Bill, while the Supreme Court of the
State adopted the crime from the bench. Alas that
it should be so! When will lawyers and judges see
that nothing short of justice can stand?</p>

<h3>GUILTY ON ALL THE ARTICLES.</h3>

<p>After this survey it is easy for me to declare how
I shall vote. My duty is to vote, Guilty on all the
Articles. If consistent with the rules of the Senate, I
should vote, “Guilty of all, and infinitely more.”</p>

<p>Not doubting that Mr. Stanton was protected by the
Tenure-of-Office Act, and that he was believed to be
so by the President, it is clear to me that the charges
in the first and second Articles are sustained. These
two go together. I have said already, in the course
of this Opinion, that the appointment of Adjutant-General
Thomas as Secretary of War <i>ad interim</i> was without
authority of law, and under the circumstances a
violation of the National Constitution. Accordingly
the third Article is sustained.</p>

<p>Then come what are called the Conspiracy Articles.
Here also I am clear. Plainly there was an agreement
between the President and Adjutant-General
Thomas to obtain possession of the War Department,
and prevent Mr. Stanton from continuing in office, and
this embraced control of the mails and property belonging
to the Department, all of which was contrary
to the Tenure-of-Office Act. Intimidation and threats
were certainly used by one of the conspirato<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>rs, and in
the case of conspiracy the acts of one are the acts of
all. The evidence that force was intended is considerable,
and all this must be interpreted by the general
character of the offender, his menacing speeches,
and the long series of transgressions preceding the conspiracy.
I cannot doubt that the conspiracy was to
obtain possession of the War Department, peaceably, if
possible, forcibly, if necessary. As such it was violation
of law, demanding the judgment of the Senate.
This disposes of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh
Articles.</p>

<p>The eighth Article charges that Adjutant-General
Thomas was appointed to obtain the control of moneys
appropriated for the military service and the Department
of War. All this would be incident to the
control of the War Department. Controlling the latter,
he would be able to wield the former. The evidence
applicable to the one is also applicable to the
other.</p>

<p>The ninth Article opens a different question. This
charges a wicked purpose to corrupt General Emory
and draw him from his military duty. Not much
passed between the President and the General; but
it was enough to show the President playing the
part of Iago. There was hypocritical profession of regard
for the Constitution, while betraying it. Here
again his past character explains his purpose beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Then come the scandalous speeches, proved as set
forth in the Articles, so that even the Senator from
West Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Van Winkle</span>] must admit that
evidence and pleading concur. Here is no question
of form. To my mind this is one of the strongest Articl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>es.
On this alone, without anything else, I should
deem it my duty to vote for expulsion from office. A
young lieutenant, at the bottom of the ladder, if guilty
of such things, would be cashiered promptly. A
President, at the top of the ladder, with less excuse
from the inexperience of early life, and with greater responsibility
from the elevation he had reached, should
be cashiered promptly also; and this is the object
of impeachment. No person capable of such speeches
should be allowed to govern this country. It is absurd
to tolerate the idea. Besides being degraded, the
country cannot be safe in such hands. The speeches
are a revelation of himself, not materially different
from well-known incidents; but they serve to exhibit
him in his true character. They show him unfit for
official trust. They were the utterances of a drunken
man; and yet it does not appear that he was drunk.
Now it is according to precedents of our history that
a person disqualified by drunkenness shall be removed
from office. This was the case of Pickering in 1804.
But a sober man, whose conduct suggests drunkenness,
is as bad at least as if he were drunk. Is he not
worse? If without the explanation of drunkenness
he makes such harangues, I cannot doubt that his unfitness
for office becomes more evident, inasmuch as
his deplorable condition is natural, and not abnormal.
The drunken man has lucid intervals; but where is
the assurance of a lucid interval for this perpetual
offender? Derangement is with him the normal condition.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to find that these infamous utterances,
where ribaldry vies with blasphemy, have received
a coat of varnish from the Senator from Maine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>], who pleads that they were not “official,”
nor did they “violate the Constitution, or any provision
of the Statute or Common Law, either in letter
or spirit.” In presence of such apologies for revolting
indecencies it is hard to preserve proper calmness. Were
they not uttered? This is enough. The drunkenness of
Andrew Johnson, when he took his oath as Vice-President,
was not “official”; but who will say that it was
not an impeachable offence? And who will say that
these expectorations differ in vileness from that drunkenness?
If they did not violate the National Constitution,
or any provision of law, common or statute, as is
apologetically alleged, I cannot doubt that they violated
the spirit of all laws. And then we are further reminded
by the apologist of that “freedom of speech” which is
a constitutional right; and thus, in the name of a great
right, we are to license utterances that shock the moral
sense, and are a scandal to human nature. Spirit of
John Milton! who pleaded so grandly for this great
liberty, but would not allow it to be confounded with
license, speak now to save this Republic from the shame
of surrender to an insufferable pretension!</p>

<p>The eleventh Article is the most comprehensive. In
some respects it is an <i>omnium gatherum</i>. In one mass
is the substance of other Articles, and something else
beside. Here is an allegation of a speech by the President
in which he denied that Congress was a Congress,
and then, in pursuance of this denial, attempted to prevent
the execution of the Tenure-of-Office Act, also of
an important clause in the Army Appropriation Act,
and also of the Reconstruction Act. Evidence followed,
sustaining completely the compound allegation. The
speech was made as set forth. The attempt to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the execution of the Tenure-of-Office Act who can question?
The attempt to corrupt General Emory is in
evidence. The whole history of the country shows
how earnest the President has been to arrest the Reconstruction
Act, and generally the Congressional scheme
of Reconstruction. The removal of Mr. Stanton was
to be relieved of an impediment. I accept this Article
in gross and in detail. It has been proved in all its
parts.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>In the judgment which I now deliver I cannot hesitate.
To my vision the path is clear as day. Never in
history was there a great case more free from all just
doubt. If Andrew Johnson is not guilty, then never
was a political offender guilty; and if his acquittal is
taken as a precedent, never can a political offender be
found guilty. The proofs are mountainous. Therefore
you are now determining whether impeachment shall
continue a beneficent remedy in the National Constitution,
or be blotted out forever, and the country handed
over to the terrible process of revolution as its sole protection.
If the milder process cannot be made effective
now, when will it ever be? Under what influences? On
what proofs? You wait for something. What? Is it
usurpation? You have it before you, open, plain, insolent.
Is it abuse of delegated power? That, too, you
have in this offender, hardly less broad than the powers
he has exercised. Is it violation of law? For more
than two years he has set your laws at defiance; and
when Congress, by special enactment, strove to constrain
him, he broke forth in rebellion against the constitutional
authority. Perhaps you ask still for something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
more. Is it a long catalogue of crime, where
violence and corruption alternate, while loyal men are
sacrificed and the Rebellion is lifted to its feet? That
also is here.</p>

<p>The apologists are prone to remind the Senate that
they are acting under the obligation of an oath. So are
the rest of us, even if we do not ostentatiously declare
it. By this oath, which is the same for all, we are
sworn to do “impartial justice.” It is justice, and this
justice must be impartial. There must be no false
weights, and no exclusion of proper weights. Therefore
I cannot allow the jargon of lawyers on mere
questions of form to sway the judgment against justice.
Nor can I consent to shut out from view the long
list of transgressions explaining and coloring the final
act of defiance. To do so is not to render impartial justice,
but to depart from this prescribed rule. The oath
we have taken is poorly kept, if we forget the Public
Safety in devices for the criminal. Above all else, now
and forever, is that justice which “holds the scales of
right with even hand.” In this sacred name, and in
the name also of country, that great charity embracing
so many other charities, I make this final protest
against all questions of form at the expense of the Republic.</p>

<p>Something also is said of the people, now watching
our proceedings with patriotic solicitude, and it has
been proclaimed that they are wrong to intrude their
judgment. I do not think so. This is a political proceeding,
which the people are as competent to decide
as the Senate. They are the multitudinous jury, coming
from no small vicinage, but from the whole country:
for on this impeachment, involving the Public Safety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the vicinage is the whole country. It is they who have
sent us here, as their representatives, and in their name,
to consult for the common weal. In nothing can we
escape their judgment, least of all on a question like
that before us. It is a mistake to suppose that the
Senate only has heard the evidence. The people have
heard it also, day by day, as it was delivered, and have
carefully considered the case on its merits, properly dismissing
all apologetic subtilties. It is for them to review
what has been done. They are above the Senate,
and will “rejudge its justice.” Thus it has been in
other cases. The popular superstition which long surrounded
the Supreme Court could not save that eminent
tribunal from condemnation, amounting sometimes to
execration, when, by an odious judgment, it undertook
to uphold Slavery; and down to this day Congress has
justly refused to place the bust of the Chief Justice
pronouncing this judgment in the hall of the tribunal
where he presided so long. His predecessors are all
there in marble; no marble of Taney is there. The
present trial, like that in the Supreme Court, is a battle
with Slavery. Acquittal is another Dred Scott decision,
and another chapter in the Barbarism of Slavery.
How can Senators, discharging a political function only,
expect that the voice of the people will be more tender
for them than for a Chief Justice pronouncing judgment
from the bench of the Supreme Court, in the exercise of
judicial power? His fate we know. Nor learning, nor
private virtues, nor venerable years could save him from
justice. In the great pillory of history he stands, and
there he must stand forever.</p>

<p>The people cannot witness wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>th indifference the abandonment
of the great Secretary, who organized their
armies against the Rebellion, and then organized victory.
Following him gratefully through the trials of
the war, they found new occasion for gratitude when
he stood out alone against that wickedness which was
lifted to power on the pistol of an assassin. During
these latter days, while tyrannical prerogative invaded
all, he has kept the bridge. When, at a similar crisis of
English history, Hampden stood out against the power
of the Crown, it is recorded by the contemporary historian,
Clarendon, that “he grew the argument of all
tongues; every man inquiring who and what he was,
that durst at his own charge support the liberty and
property of the kingdom, and rescue his country, as he
thought, from being made a prey to the Court.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Such
things are also said with equal force of our Secretary.
Nor is it forgotten that the Senate, by two solemn
votes of more than two thirds, has twice instructed him
to stay at the War Department, the President to the
contrary notwithstanding. The people will not easily
understand on what principle of Constitution, law, or
morals, the Senate can twice instruct the Secretary to
stay, and then, by another vote, deliberately surrender
him a prey to Presidential tyranny. Talk of a somersault;
talk of self-stultification: are not both here?
God save me from participation in this disastrous
wrong, and may He temper it kindly to our afflicted
country!</p>

<p>For myself, I cannot despair of the Republic. It is
a life-boat, which wind and wave cannot sink; but it
may suffer much and be beaten by storm. All this I
clearly see before us, if you fail to displace an unfit
commander, whose power is a peril and a shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas for all the evil that must break upon the country,
especially in the suffering South, as it goes forth
that this bad man is confirmed in the prerogatives he
has usurped!</p>

<p>Alas for that peace and reconciliation, the longing of
good men, now postponed!</p>

<p>Alas for that security, so important to all, as the
only foundation on which to build, politically or financially!
This, too, is postponed. How can people found
a government, or plant or buy, unless first secure?</p>

<p>Alas for the Republic, degraded as never before,
while the Whiskey Ring holds its orgy of corruption,
and the Ku-Klux-Klan holds its orgy of blood!</p>

<p>Alas for the hearts of the people, bruised to unutterable
sadness, as they witness a cruel tyranny installed
once more!</p>

<p>Alas for that race so long oppressed, but at last redeemed
from bondage, now plunged back into another
hell of torment!</p>

<p>Alas for the fresh graves already beginning to yawn,
while violence, armed with your verdict, goes forth, like
another Fury, and murder is quickened anew!</p>

<p>Alas for the Unionists, white and black alike, who
have trusted to our flag! You offer them a sacrifice to
persecutors whose representative is before you for judgment.
They are the last in my thoughts, as I pronounce
that vote which is too feeble to save them from intolerable
wrong and outrage. They are fellow-citizens of a
common country, brethren of a common humanity, two
commanding titles, both strong against the deed. I send
them at this terrible moment the sympathy and fellowship
of a heart that suffers with them. So just a cause
cannot be lost. Meanwhile, may they find in themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
and in the goodness of an overruling Providence,
that refuge and protection which the Senate refuses to
give!</p>

THEIR VOTES IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT.</h2>

<div class="medium">

<p>June 3d, Mr. Sumner submitted the following Resolutions, which
were read and ordered to be printed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whereas a pretension has been put forth to the
effect that the vote of a Senator on an impeachment
is so far different in character from his vote on
any other question that the people have no right to
criticize or consider it; and whereas such pretension, if
not discountenanced, is calculated to impair that freedom
of judgment which belongs to the people on all
that is done by their representatives: Therefore, in order
to remove all doubts on this question, and to declare
the constitutional right of the people in cases of impeachment,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Resolved</i>, That, even assuming that the Senate is a
Court in the exercise of judicial power, Senators cannot
claim that their votes are exempt from the judgment of
the people; that the Supreme Court, when it has undertaken
to act on questions essentially political in character,
has not escaped this judgment; that the decisions
of this high tribunal in support of Slavery have been
openly condemned; that the memorable utterance known
as the Dred Scott decision was indignantly denounced
and repudiated, while the Chief Justice who pronounced
it became a mark for censure and rebuke; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
plainly the votes of Senators on an impeachment cannot
enjoy an immunity from popular judgment which has
been denied to the Supreme Court, with Taney as Chief
Justice.</p>

<p>2. <i>Resolved</i>, That the Senate is not at any time a
Court invested with judicial power, but that it is always
a Senate with specific functions declared by the Constitution;
that, according to express words, “the judicial
power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme
Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress
may from time to time ordain and establish,” while it is
further provided that “the Senate shall have the sole
power to try all impeachments,” thus positively making
a distinction between the judicial power and the power
to try impeachments; that the Senate, on an impeachment,
does not exercise any portion of the judicial power,
but another and different power, exclusively delegated
to the Senate, having for its sole object removal from
office and disqualification therefor; that, by the terms
of the Constitution, there may be, after conviction on
impeachment, a further trial and punishment “according
to law,” thus making a discrimination between a
proceeding by impeachment and a proceeding “according
to law”; that the proceeding by impeachment is not
“according to law,” and is not attended by legal punishment,
but is of an opposite character, and from beginning
to end political, being instituted by a political
body on account of political offences, being conducted
before another political body having political power
only, and ending in a judgment which is political only;
and therefore the vote of a Senator on impeachment,
though different in form, is not different in responsibility,
from his vote on any other political question;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
nor can any Senator, on such an occasion, claim immunity
from that just accountability which the representative
at all times owes to his constituents.</p>

<p>3. <i>Resolved</i>, That Senators in all that they do are under
the constant obligation of an oath, binding them to the
strictest rectitude; that on an impeachment they take
a further oath, according to the requirement of the Constitution,
which says, Senators, when sitting to try impeachment,
“shall be on oath or affirmation”; that this
simple requirement was never intended to change the
character of the Senate as a political body, and cannot
have any such operation; and therefore Senators,
whether before or after the supplementary oath, are
equally responsible to the people for their votes,&mdash;it
being the constitutional right of the people at all times
to sit in judgment on their representatives.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate having under consideration the bill to admit the States
of North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, and Alabama to
representation in Congress, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;What I have to say to-day
will be confined to a single topic. I shall speak
of <i>the validity and necessity of fundamental conditions
on the admission of States into the body of the Nation</i>,&mdash;passing
in review objections founded on the asserted
equality of States, and also on a misinterpretation of
the power to determine the “qualifications” of electors,
and that other power to make “regulations” for the
election of certain officers. Here I shall encounter the
familiar pretensions of another time, no longer put forth
by defiant Slave-Masters, but retailed by conscientious
Senators, who think they are supporting the Constitution,
when they are only echoing the voice of Slavery.</p>

<p>Fundamental conditions on the admission of States
are older than our Constitution; for they appear in
the Ordinance for the vast Territory of the Northwest,
adopted anterior to the Constitution itself. In that
Ordinance there are various conditions, of perpetual
obligation, as articles of compact. Among these is the
famous prohibition of Slavery. In the early days of our
Nation nobody thought of questioning the validity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
these conditions. Scattered efforts were made to carry
Slavery into some portions of this region, and unquestionably
there were sporadic cases, as in Massachusetts
itself; but the Ordinance stood firm and unimpeached.</p>

<p>One assurance of its authority will be found in the
historic fact, that in 1820, on the admission of Missouri
as a State of the Union, there was a further
provision that in all territory of the United States
north of 36° 30´ north latitude, “Slavery and involuntary
servitude, otherwise than in the punishment of
crimes, whereof the parties shall have been duly convicted,
shall be and is hereby <span class="smcapuc">FOREVER</span> <i>prohibited</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
This was the famous Missouri Compromise. Missouri
was admitted as a State without any restriction of
Slavery, but all the outlying territory west and north
was subjected to this condition <i>forever</i>. It will be
observed that the condition was in no respect temporary,
but that it was “forever,”&mdash;thus outlasting any
territorial government, and constituting a fundamental
law, irrepealable through all time. Surely this condition,
perpetual in form, would not have been introduced,
had it been supposed to be inoperative,&mdash;had
it been regarded as a sham, and not a reality. This
statute, therefore, testifies to the judgment of Congress
at that time.</p>

<p>It was only at a later day, and at the demand of
Slavery, that the validity of the great Ordinance of
Freedom was called in question. Mr. Webster, in his
memorable debate with Mr. Hayne in 1830, vindicated
this measure in language worthy of the cause and of
himself, giving to it a palm among the laws by which
civilization has been advanced, and asserting its e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>nduring
character:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are accustomed, Sir, to praise the lawgivers of antiquity;
we help to perpetuate the fame of Solon and Lycurgus;
but I doubt whether one single law of any lawgiver, ancient
or modern, has produced effects of more distinct, marked, and
lasting character than the Ordinance of 1787.… It fixed
forever the character of the population in the vast regions
northwest of the Ohio, by excluding from them involuntary
servitude. It impressed on the soil itself, while it was yet a
wilderness, an incapacity to sustain any other than freemen.
<i>It laid the interdict against personal servitude in original
compact, not only deeper than all local law, but deeper also
than all local constitutions.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Words of greater beauty and power cannot be found
anywhere in the writings or speeches of our American
orator. It would be difficult to declare the perpetual
character of this original interdict more completely.
The language is as picturesque as truthful. Deeper
than all local law, deeper than all local constitutions,
is this fundamental law; and such is its essential quality,
that the soil which it protects cannot sustain any
other than freemen. Of such a law the orator naturally
proceeded to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We see its consequences at this moment; and we shall
never cease to see them, perhaps, while the Ohio shall flow.
<i>It was a great and salutary measure of prevention.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In these last words the value of such a law is declared.
It is for <i>prevention</i>, which is an essential object of all
law. In this case it is the more important, as the evil
to be prevented is the most comprehensive of all.</p>

<p>Therefore, on the authority of Mr. Webster, in ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>rmony
with reason also, do I say, that this original
condition was not only perpetual in character, but beneficent
also. It was beneficence in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase, in his admirable argument before the Supreme
Court of the United States, in the <i>Vanzandt</i> case,
is hardly behind Mr. Webster in homage to this Ordinance,
or in a sense of its binding character. In his
opinion it is a compact of perpetual obligation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I know not that history records a sublimer act than
this. The United American States, having just brought their
perilous struggle for freedom and independence to a successful
issue, proceeded to declare the terms and conditions on
which their vacant territory might be settled and organized
into States; and these terms were, not tribute, not render
of service, not subordination of any kind, but <i>the perpetual
maintenance of the genuine principles of American Liberty,
declared to be incompatible with Slavery</i>; and that these
principles might be inviolably maintained, they were made
<i>the articles of a solemn covenant</i> between the original States,
then the proprietors of the territory and responsible for its
future destiny, and the people and the States who were to
occupy it. Every settler within the territory, by the very
act of settlement, became a party to this <i>compact, bound
by its perpetual obligations</i>, and entitled to the full benefit
of its excellent provisions for himself and his posterity. No
subsequent act of the original States could affect it, without
his consent. <i>No act of his, nor of the people of the
territory, nor of the States established within it, could affect
it, without the consent of the original States.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

</div>

<p>According to these words, which I am sure would
not be disowned by the present Chief Justice of the
United States, the Ordinance is a sublime act, having
for its object nothing less than <i>the perpetual m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>aintenance
of the genuine principles of American Liberty</i>. In
form it is a compact, unalterable except by the consent
of the parties, and therefore <i>forever</i>.</p>

<p>If anything in our history is settled by original
authority, supported by tradition and time, it is the
binding character of the Ordinance for the Government
of the Northwest Territory. Nobody presumed to call
it in question, until at last Slavery flung down its
challenge to everything that was settled for Freedom.
The great Ordinance, with its prohibition of Slavery,
was not left unassailed.</p>

<p>All this makes a strange, eventful passage of history.
The enlightened civilization of the age was beginning
to be felt against Slavery, when its representatives
turned madly round to confront the angel of
light. The madness showed itself by degrees. Point
by point it made itself manifest in Congress. The
Slave-Masters forgot morals, history, and the Constitution.
Their manifold pretensions resolved themselves
into three, in which the others were absorbed: first,
that Slavery, instead of an evil to be removed, was a
blessing to be preserved; secondly, that the right of
petition could not be exercised against Slavery; thirdly,
that, in all that concerns Slavery, State Rights were
everything, while National Rights were nothing. These
three pretensions entered into Congress, like so many
devils, and possessed it. The first broke forth in eulogies
of Slavery, and even in blandishments for the
Slave-Trade. The second broke forth in the “Atherton
Gag,” under which the honest, earnest petitions from the
national heart against Slavery, even in the District of
Columbia, were tabled without reference, and the great
Right of Petition, promised by the Constitution, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
a dead letter. The third, beginning with the denial
of the power of the Nation to affix upon new States
the perpetual condition of Human Rights, broke forth
in the denial of the power of the Nation over Slavery
in the Territories or anywhere else, even within the
national jurisdiction. These three pretensions all had
a common origin, and one was as offensive and unreasonable
as another. The praise of Slavery and the
repudiation of the Right of Petition by the enraged
Slave-Masters were not worse than the pretension of
State Rights against the power of the Nation to prohibit
Slavery in the national jurisdiction, or to affix
righteous conditions upon new States.</p>

<p>The first two pretensions have disappeared. These
two devils have been cast out. Nobody dares to praise
Slavery; nobody dares to deny the Right of Petition.
The third pretension has disappeared only so far as it
denied the power of the Nation over Slavery in the
Territories; and we are still doomed to hear, in the
name of State Rights, the old cry against conditions
upon new States. This devil is not yet entirely cast
out. Pardon me, if I insist upon putting the national
rights over the Territories and the national rights over
new States before their admission in the same category.
These rights not only go together, but they are
one and the same. They are not merely companion
and cognate, but they are identical. The one is necessarily
involved in the other. Prohibition in the Territories
is prolonged in conditions upon new States.
The Ordinance of 1787, which is the great example,
asserts the <i>perpetuity</i> of all its prohibitions; and this
is the rule alike of law and statesmanship. Vain were
its prohibitions, if they fell dead in presence of State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Rights. The pretension is too irrational. The Missouri
Act takes up the rule asserted in the Ordinance,
and declares that in certain Territories Slavery shall
be prohibited <i>forever</i>. A territorial existence terminating
in State Rights is a short-lived <i>forever</i>. Only
by recognizing the power of the Nation over the States
formed out of the Territory can this <i>forever</i> have a
meaning above the prattle of childhood or the vaunt
of Bombastes.</p>

<p>The whole pretension against the proposed condition
is in the name of State Rights; but it cannot be
doubted that it may be traced directly to Slavery.
Shall the pretension be allowed to prevail, now that
Slavery has disappeared? The principal has fallen;
why preserve the incident? The wrong guarded by
this pretension has yielded; why should not the pretension
yield also? Asserting, as I now do, the validity
and necessity of the proposed condition, I would
not seem indifferent to the rights of the States in those
proper spheres appointed for them. Unquestionably
States have rights under the Constitution, which we
are bound to respect,&mdash;nay, more, which are a source
of strength and advantage. It is through the States
that the people everywhere govern themselves, and
our Nation is saved from a central domination. Here
is the appointed function of the States. They supply
the machinery of local self-government for the convenience
of life, while they ward off the attempts of
an absorbing imperialism. <i>But there can be no State
Rights against Human Rights.</i> Because a State, constituting
part of a Nation dedicated to Human Rights,
may govern itself and supply the machinery of local
self-government, <i>it does not follow that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> such a State may
deny Human Rights within its borders</i>. State Rights,
when properly understood, are entirely consistent with
the maintenance of Human Rights by the Nation. The
State is not humbled, when it receives the mandate of
the Nation to do no wrong; nor can the Nation err, when
it asserts everywhere within its borders the imperialism
of Human Rights. Against this righteous supremacy
all pretensions of States must disappear, as darkness
before the King of Day.</p>

<p>The song of State Rights has for its constant refrain
the asserted <i>Equality of the States</i>. Is it not strange
that words so constantly employed as a cover for pretensions
against Human Rights cannot be found in the
Constitution? It is true, that, by the Laws of Nations,
all sovereign States, great or small, are equal; but this
principle has been extended without authority to States
created by the Nation and made a part of itself. There
is but one active provision in the Constitution which
treats the States as equal, and this provision shows how
this very Equality may be waived. Every State, large
or small, has two Senators, and the Constitution places
this Equality of States under its safeguard by providing
that “no State, <i>without its consent</i>, shall be deprived of
its <i>equal suffrage</i> in the Senate.” But this very text
contains what lawyers might call a “negative pregnant,”
being a negation of the right to change this rule,
with an affirmation that it may be changed. The State,
<i>with its consent</i>, may be deprived of its equal suffrage
in the Senate. And this is the whole testimony of the
Constitution to that Equality of States which is now
asserted in derogation of all compacts or conditions. It
is startling to find how constantly the obvious conclusions
from the text of the Constitution have been overlooked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Even in the contemplation of the Constitution
itself, a State may waive its equal suffrage in the Senate,
so as to be represented by a single Senator only.
Of course, all this must depend on its own consent,
in concurrence with the Nation. Nothing is said of
the manner in which this consent may be given by the
State or accepted by the Nation. But if this important
limitation can in any way be made the subject of agreement
or compact, pray, Sir, where will you stop? What
other power or prerogative of the State may not be limited
also, especially where there is nothing in the Constitution
against any such limitation? All this I adduce
simply by way of illustration. There is no question
now of any limitation, in the just sense of this term. A
condition in favor of Human Rights cannot be a limitation
on a State or on a citizen.</p>

<p>If we look further, and see how the Senatorial equality
of States obtained recognition in the Constitution,
we shall find new occasion to admire that facility which
has accorded to this concession so powerful an influence;
and here the record is explicit. The National
Convention had hardly assembled, when the small States
came forward with their pretensions. Not content with
suffrage in the Senate, they insisted upon equal suffrage
in the House of Representatives. They had in their
favor the rule of the Continental Congress, and also of
the Confederation, under which each State enjoyed one
vote. Assuming to be independent sovereignties, they
had likewise in their favor the rule of International Law.
Against these pretensions the large States pleaded the
simple rule of justice; and here the best minds concurred.
On this head the debates of the Convention are
interesting. At an early day we find Mr. Madison moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
“that the equality of suffrage established by the
Articles of Confederation ought not to prevail in the
<i>National</i> Legislature.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> This proposition, so consistent
with reason, was seconded by Gouverneur Morris, and,
according to the report, “being generally relished,” was
about being adopted, when Delaware, by one of her
voices on the floor, protested, saying, that, in case it were
adopted, “it might become the duty of her deputies to
retire from the Convention.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Such was the earliest cry
of Secession. Gouverneur Morris, while observing that
the valuable assistance of those members could not be
lost without real concern, gave his testimony, that “the
change proposed was so fundamental an article in a
<i>National</i> Government that it could not be dispensed
with.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Mr. Madison followed, saying, very justly, that,
“whatever reason might have existed for the equality of
suffrage when the Union was a Federal one <i>among sovereign
States</i>, it must cease when a <i>National</i> government
should be put into the place.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Franklin, in similar
spirit, reminded the Convention that the equal suffrage
of the States “was submitted to originally by Congress
under a conviction of its impropriety, inequality, and
injustice.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> This is strong language from the wise old
man, but very true. Elbridge Gerry, after depicting the
States as “intoxicated with the idea of their sovereignty,”
said that “the injustice of allowing each State an
equal vote was long insisted on. He voted for it; but
it was against his judgment, and under the pressure of
public danger and the obstinacy of the lesser States.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Against these overwhelming words of Madison, Morris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Franklin, and Gerry, the delegates from Delaware pleaded
nothing more than that, without an equal suffrage, “Delaware
would have about one ninetieth for its share in
the general councils, whilst Pennsylvania and Virginia
would possess one third of the whole”;<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and New Jersey,
by her delegates, pleaded also “that it would not
be safe for Delaware to allow Virginia sixteen times as
many votes” as herself.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> On the part of the small States,
the effort was for power disproportioned to size. On the
part of the large States there was a protest against the
injustice and inequality of these pretensions, especially
in a government national in its character. The question
was settled by the great compromise of the Constitution,
according to which representation in the House
of Representatives was proportioned to population, while
each State was entitled to an equal suffrage in the Senate.
To this extent the small States prevailed, and the
Senate ever since has testified to the equality of States;
or rather, according to the language of the “Federalist”
on this very point, it has been “a palladium to the residuary
sovereignty of the States.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Thus, by the pertinacity
of the small States, was this concession extorted
from the Convention, in defiance of every argument of
justice and equity, and contrary to the judgment of the
best minds; and now it is exalted into a universal rule
of Constitutional Law, before which justice and equity
must hide their faces.</p>

<p>This protracted and recurring conflict in the Convention
is compendiously set forth by our great authority,
Judge Story, when he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It constituted one of the great struggles between the
large and the small States, which was constantly renewed in
the Convention, and impeded it in every step of its progress
in the formation of the Constitution. The struggle applied
to the organization of each branch of the Legislature. The
small States insisted upon an equality of vote and representation
in each branch, and the large States upon a vote in proportion
to their relative importance and population.…
The small States at length yielded the point as to an equality
of representation in the House, and acceded to a representation
proportionate to the Federal numbers. But they insisted
upon an equality in the Senate. To this the large
States were unwilling to assent, and for a time the States
were on this point equally divided.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>This summary is in substantial harmony with my
own abstract of the debates. I present it because I
would not seem in any way to overstate the case. And
here let me add most explicitly, that I lend no voice
to any complaint against the small States; nor do I
suggest any change in the original balances of our system.
I insist only that the victory achieved in the
Constitution by the small States shall not be made
the apology for a pretension inconsistent with Human
Rights. And now, for the sake of a great cause, the
truth must be told.</p>

<p>It must not be disguised that this pretension has another
origin, outside the Constitution. This is in the
Ordinance of 1787, where it is positively provided that
any State formed out of the Northwest Territory “shall
be admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the
United States <i>on an equal footing with the original States
in all respects whatever</i>.” Next after the equal suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>frage
in the Senate stands this provision with its talismanic
phrase, <i>equal footing</i>. New States are to be admitted
on an <i>equal footing</i> with the original States in all respects
whatever. This language is strong; but nobody
can doubt that it must be read in the light of the Ordinance
where it appears. Read in this light, its meaning
cannot be questioned. By the Ordinance there are no
less than six different articles of compact, “forever unalterable,
unless by common consent,” constituting so
many perpetual safeguards: the first perpetuating religious
liberty; the second perpetuating <i>Habeas Corpus</i>,
trial by jury, and judicial proceedings according to the
course of the Common Law; the third perpetuating
schools and the means of education; the fourth perpetuating
the title of the United States in the soil without
taxation, the freedom of the rivers as highways, and
the liability of the people for a just proportion of the
national debt; the fifth perpetuating the right of the
States to be admitted into the Union on an <i>equal footing</i>
with the original States; and then, next in order,
the sixth perpetuating freedom,&mdash;being that immortal
condition which is the golden bough of this mighty oak,&mdash;that
“there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude in the said Territory.” Now it is clear that
subjection to these perpetual conditions was not considered
in any respect inconsistent with that “equal footing”
which was stipulated. Therefore, even assuming
that States, when admitted, shall be on an “equal footing”
with others, there can be no hindrance to any conditions
by Congress kindred to those which were the
glory of the Ordinance.</p>

<p>To all who, borrowing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> catchword from Slavery, assert
the Equality of States in derogation of fundamental
conditions, I oppose the plain text of the Constitution,
which contains no such rule, except in a single instance,
and there the equality may be waived; and I oppose
also the Ordinance of 1787, which, while requiring that
new States shall be admitted on an “equal footing”
with other States, teaches by its own great example
that this requirement is not inconsistent with conditions
of all kinds, and especially in favor of Human
Rights. The Equality of States on the lips of Slave-Masters
was natural, for it was a plausible defence
against the approaches of Freedom; but this unauthorized
phrase, which has deceived so many, must be rejected
now, so far at least as it is employed against
the Equal Rights of All. As one of the old garments
of Slavery, it must be handed to the flames.</p>

<p>From this review it is easy to see that we approach
the present question without any impediment or constraint
in the Constitution. Not a provision, not a
clause, not a sentence, not a phrase in the Constitution
can be made an apology even for the present
objection,&mdash;absolutely nothing; and here I challenge
reply. Without any support in the Constitution, its
partisans borrow one of the worst pretensions of Slavery,
and utter it now as it was uttered by Slave-Masters.
Once more we hear the voice of Slavery crying
out in familiar tones, that conditions cannot be imposed
on new States. Alas that Slavery, which we thought
had been slain, is not entirely dead! Again it stalks
into this Chamber, like the majesty of buried Denmark,&mdash;“in
the same figure, like the king that’s dead,”&mdash;and
then, like this same ghost, it cries out, “Swear!” and
then again, “Swear!”&mdash;and Senators pledged to Freedom
take up the old pretension and swear it anew. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
myself, I insist not only that Slavery shall be buried
out of sight, but that all its wretched pretensions hostile
to Human Rights shall be buried with it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The conditions upon new States are of two classes:
<i>first</i>, those that <i>may</i> be required; <i>secondly</i>, those that
<i>must</i> be required.</p>

<p>The first comprehends those conditions which the
Nation may consider it advisable to require, before
admitting a new member into the partnership of government.
The Constitution, in positive words, leaves
to the Nation a discretion with regard to the admission
of new States. The words are: “New States <i>may</i>
be admitted by the Congress into the Union,”&mdash;thus
plainly recognizing a latitude under which any conditions
not inconsistent with the Constitution may be required,
as by a firm on the admission of a new partner.
All this is entirely reasonable; but I do not stop to
dwell on it, for the condition which I have at heart
does not come under this head.</p>

<p>A fundamental condition in favor of Human Rights
is of that essential character that it <i>must</i> be required.
Not to require it is to abandon a plain duty; so it
seems to me. I speak with all deference to others,
but I cannot see it otherwise.</p>

<p>The Constitution declares that “the United States
shall guaranty to every State in this Union <i>a republican
form of government</i>.” These are grand words,
perhaps the grandest in the Constitution, hardly excepting
the Preamble, which is so full of majestic
meaning and such a fountain of national life. Kindred
to the Preamble is this supreme obligation imposed
on the United States to guaranty a republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
government. There it is. You cannot avoid this duty.
Called to its performance, you must supply a practical
definition of a republican government. This again you
cannot avoid. By your oaths, by all the responsibilities
of your position, you must say what in your judgment
is a republican government, and you must so decide
as not to discredit our fathers and not to give an unworthy
example to mankind. Happily the definition
is already of record in our history. Our fathers gave
it to us, as amid the thunders of Sinai, when they
put forth their Declaration of Independence. There it
stands in the very front of our Great Charter, embodied
in two simple, self-evident truths,&mdash;first, that all men
are equal in rights, and, secondly, that all just government
is founded only on the consent of the governed,&mdash;the
two together making an axiomatic definition
which proves itself. Its truth is like the sun; blind
is he who cannot see it. And this is the definition
bequeathed as a freehold by our fathers. Though often
assailed, even by Senators, it is none the less true. So
have I read of savages who shot their arrows at the
sun. Clearly, then, that is a republican government
where all have equal rights and participate in the government.
I know not if anything need be added; I
am sure that nothing can be subtracted.</p>

<p>The Constitution itself sets the example of imposing
conditions upon the States. Positively it says, no State
shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;
no State shall grant letters of marque and reprisal; no
State shall coin money; no State shall emit bills of
credit. Again it says, no State shall, without the consent
of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage, or keep troops
or ships of war in time of peace. All these are conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
in the text of the Constitution so plain and intelligible
as to require no further elucidation. To repeat
them on the admission of a State would be superfluous.
It is different, however, with that highest condition of
all, that the State shall be republican. This requires
repetition and elucidation, so as to remove all doubt of
its application, and to vitalize it by declaring what is
meant by a republican government.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I might close this argument; but there are two
hostile pretensions which must be exposed: the first
founded on a false interpretation of “qualifications,”
being nothing less than the impossible assumption, that,
because the States may determine the “qualifications”
of electors, therefore they can make color a criterion
of the electoral franchise; and the second founded on
a false interpretation of the asserted power of the
States “to regulate suffrage,” being nothing less than
the impossible assumption that under the power to
regulate suffrage the rights of a whole race may be
annihilated. These two pretensions are of course derived
from Slavery. They are hatched from the eggs
that the cuckoo bird has left behind. Strange that
Senators will hatch them!</p>

<p>1. By the Constitution it is provided that “the electors
in each State shall have the <i>qualifications</i> requisite
for electors of the most numerous branch of the
State Legislature.” On this clause Senators build the
impossible pretension that a State cannot be interrupted
in its disfranchisement of a race. Here is the
argument: Because a State may determine the
<i>qualifications</i> of electors, <i>therefore</i> it may deprive a whole
race of equal rights and of participation i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>n the Government.
Logically speaking, here are most narrow
premises for the widest possible conclusion. On the
mere statement, the absurdity is so unspeakable as to
recall the kindred pretension of Slavery, that, because
commerce is lawful, therefore commerce in human flesh
is lawful also. If the consequences were not so offensive,
this “argal” might be handed over to consort
with that of the Shakespearean grave-digger. But the
argument is not merely preposterous, it is insulting to
the human understanding, and a blow at human nature
itself. If I use strong language, it is because such
a proclamation of tyranny requires it. Admitting that
the States may determine the “qualifications” of electors,
what then? Obviously it must be according to the
legitimate meaning of this word. And here, besides
reason and humanity, two inexhaustible fountains, we
have two other sources of authority: first, the Constitution,
in which the word appears, and, secondly, the dictionaries
of the English language, out of both of which
we must condemn the intolerable pretension.</p>

<p>The Constitution, where we find this word, follows the
Declaration of Independence, and refuses to recognize
any distinction of color. Search, and you will confess
that there is no word of “color” in its text; nor is there
anything there on which to found any disfranchisement
of a race. The “qualifications” of different officers, as
President, Vice-President, Senators, and Representatives,
are named; but “color” is not among these. The Constitution,
like the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes,
embraces all alike within its mandates and all
alike within its promises. There are none who must
not obey it; there can be none who may not claim
its advantages. By what title do you exclude a rac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>e?
The Constitution gives no such title; you can only find
it in yourselves. The fountain is pure; it is only out
of yourselves that the waters of bitterness proceed.</p>

<p>The dictionaries of our language are in harmony with
the Constitution. Look at “Qualification” in Webster
or Worcester, the two best authorities of our time, and
you will find that the word means “fitness,” “capability,”
“accomplishment,” “the condition of being qualified”;
but it does not mean “color.” It embraces age, residence,
character, education, and the payment of taxes,&mdash;in
short, all those conditions which, when honestly
administered, are in the nature of <i>regulation</i>, not of <i>disfranchisement</i>.
The English dictionaries most used by
the framers of the Constitution were Bailey and Johnson.
According to Bailey, who was the earliest, this
important word is thus defined:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“(1.) <i>That which fits any person or thing for any particular
purpose.</i>”</p>

<p>“(2.) <i>A particular faculty or endowment, an accomplishment.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">According to Johnson, who is the highest authority, it
is thus defined:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“(1.) <i>That which makes any person or thing fit for anything.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span>&mdash;“It is in the power of the prince to make
piety and virtue become the fashion, if he would make them
necessary <i>qualifications</i> for preferment.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Swift.</span>”</p>

<p>“(2.) <i>Accomplishment.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span>&mdash;“Good <i>qualifications</i> of mind enable a magistrate
to perform his duty, and tend to create a public esteem
of him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Atterbury.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> these definitions this word means “fitness,” or
“accomplishment,” and, according to the well-chosen
examples from Swift and Atterbury, it means qualities
like “piety” and “virtue,” or like faculties “of mind,”
all of which are more or less within the reach of every
human being. But it is impossible to extend this list so
as to make “color” a quality,&mdash;absolutely impossible.
Color is a physical condition affixed by the God of Nature
to a large portion of the human race, and insurmountable
in its character. Age, education, residence,
property,&mdash;all these are subject to change; but the
Ethiopian cannot change his skin. On this last distinctive
circumstance I take my stand. <i>An insurmountable
condition is not a qualification, but a disfranchisement.</i>
Admit that a State may determine the
“qualifications” of electors, it cannot, under this authority,
arbitrarily exclude a whole race.</p>

<p>Try this question by examples. Suppose South Carolina,
where the blacks are numerous, should undertake
to exclude the whites from the polls on account of
“color”; would you hesitate to arrest this injustice?
You would insist that a government sanctioning such
a denial of rights, under whatever pretension, could
not be republican. Suppose another State should gravely
declare that <i>all with black eyes</i> should be excluded
from the polls, and still another should gravely declare
that <i>all with black hair</i> should be excluded from the
polls, I am sure that you would find it difficult to restrain
the mingled derision and indignation which such
a pretension must excite. But this fable pictures your
conduct. All this is now gravely done by States; and
Senators gravely insist that such exclusion is proper in
determining the “qualifications” of electors.</p>

<p>2. Like unto the pretension founded on a misi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>nterpretation
of “qualifications” is that other founded on
a misinterpretation of the asserted power of a State
to make “regulations.” Listen to this pretension. Assuming
that a State may <i>regulate</i> the elections without
the intervention of Congress, it is insisted that it
may disfranchise a race. Because a State may regulate
the elective franchise, <i>therefore</i> it may destroy this
franchise. Surely it is one thing to regulate, and quite
another thing to destroy. The power to regulate cannot
involve any such conclusion of tyranny. To every
such wretched result, howsoever urged, there is one
sufficient reply,&mdash;<i>Non sequitur</i>.</p>

<p>According to the Constitution, “the <i>times, places, and
manner</i> of holding elections for Senators and Representatives
shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature
thereof; but the Congress may at any time by
law make or alter such <i>regulations</i>, except as to the
places of choosing Senators.” Here is the text of this
portentous power to blast a race. In these simple words
no such power can be found, unless the seeker makes
the Constitution a reflection of himself. The times,
places, and manner of holding elections are referred to
the States,&mdash;nothing more; and even these may be
altered by Congress. Being matters of form and convenience
only, in the nature of <i>police</i>, they are justly
included under the head of “regulations,” like the sword
and uniform of the army. Do we not familiarly speak
of a <i>regulation</i> sword and a <i>regulation</i> sash? Who will
dare to say that under this formal power of <i>regulation</i>
a whole race may be despoiled of equal rights and of all
participation in the Government? This very pretension
was anticipated by Mr. Madison, and condemned in
advance. Here are his decisive words in the Virginia
Convention:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some States might regulate the elections on the principles
of equality, and others might regulate them otherwise.…
Should the people of any State by any means be deprived
of the right of suffrage, <i>it was judged proper that it should be
remedied by the General Government</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus was it expressly understood, at the adoption of
the Constitution, that Congress should have the power
to prevent any State, under the pretence of regulating
the suffrage, from depriving the people of this right, or
from interfering with the principle of <i>Equality</i>.</p>

<p>Kindred to this statement of Mr. Madison is that
other contemporary testimony which will be found in
the “Federalist,” where the irrepealable rights of citizens
are recognized without distinction of color. This
explicit language cannot be too often quoted. Here
it is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed
the negroes into subjects of property that a place is
denied to them in the computation of numbers; and it is
admitted, that, if the laws were to restore the rights which
have been taken away, <i>the negroes could no longer be refused
an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This testimony is as decisive as it is authentic. Consider
that it was given in explanation and vindication
of the Constitution. Consider that the Constitution was
commended for adoption by the assertion, that, on the
termination of Slavery, “the negroes could no longer be
refused an <i>equal share</i> of representation with the other
inhabitants.” In the face of this assurance, how can it
be now insisted, that, under the simple power to regulate
the suffrage, a State may deny to a whole race that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
“equal share of representation” which was promised?
Thus from every quarter we are brought to the same
inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p>Therefore I dismiss the pretension founded on the
power to make <i>regulations</i>, as I dismiss that other
founded on the power to determine <i>qualifications</i>. Each
proceeds on a radical misconception. Admit that a
State may determine <i>qualifications</i>; admit that a State
may make <i>regulations</i>; it cannot follow, by any rule of
logic or law, that, under these powers, either or both,
it may disfranchise a race. The pretension is too lofty.
No such enormous prerogative can be wrung out of any
such moderate power. As well say, that, because a constable
or policeman may keep order in a city, therefore
he may inflict the penalty of death,&mdash;or, because a father
may impose proper restraint upon a child, therefore he
may sell him into slavery. We have read of an effort
to extract sunbeams out of cucumbers; but the present
effort to extract a cruel prerogative out of the simple
words of the Constitution is scarcely less absurd.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I conclude as I began, in favor of requiring conditions
from States on their admission into the Nation;
and I insist that it is our especial duty, in every possible
way, by compact and by enactment, to assure
among these conditions the Equal Rights of All, and the
participation of every citizen in the government over
him, without which the State cannot be republican.
For the present I confine myself to the question of
conditions on the admission of States, without considering
the broader obligation of Congress to make Equal
Rights coextensive with the Nation, and thus to harmonize
our institutions with the principles of the Decl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>aration
of Independence. That other question I leave
to another occasion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I protest against the false glosses originally
fastened upon the Constitution by Slavery, and,
now continued, often in unconsciousness of their origin,
perverting it to the vilest uses of tyranny. I protest
against that exaggeration of pretension which out
of a power to make “regulations” and to determine
“qualifications” can derive an unrepublican prerogative.
I protest against that pretension which would
make the asserted Equality of States the cover for a
denial of the Equality of Men. The one is an artificial
rule, relating to artificial bodies; the other is a
natural rule, relating to natural bodies. The one is
little more than a legal fiction; the other is a truth
of Nature. Here is a distinction which Alexander
Hamilton recognized, when, in the debates of the Convention,
he nobly said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As States are a collection of individual men, which
ought we to respect most,&mdash;the rights of the people composing
them, or of the artificial beings resulting from the
composition? Nothing could be more preposterous or absurd
than to sacrifice the former to the latter.”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

</div>

<p>High above States, as high above men, are those
commanding principles which cannot be denied with
impunity. They will be found in the Declaration of
Independence, expressed so clearly that all can read
them. Though few, they are mighty. There is no
humility in bending to their behests. As man rises
in the scale of being while walking in obedience to
the Divine will, so is a State elevated by obedien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>ce
to these everlasting truths. Nor can we look for harmony
in our country until these principles bear unquestioned
sway, without any interdict from the States.
That unity for which the Nation longs, with peace and
reconciliation in its train, can be assured only through
the Equal Rights of All, proclaimed by the Nation everywhere
within its limits, and maintained by the national
arm. Then will the Constitution be filled and inspired
by the Declaration of Independence, so that the two
shall be one, with a common life, a common authority,
and a common glory.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have never given any opinion in
regard to the Senatorial question in your State,
except to express regret that the golden opportunity
should be lost of making a colored citizen Senator from
South Carolina.</p>

<p>Such a Senator, if competent, would be a powerful
support to the cause of Equal Rights. His presence
alone would be a constant testimony and argument.
Nothing could do so much to settle the question of
Equal Rights forever in the United States. The howl
against the negro, which is sometimes heard in the
Senate, would cease. A colored Senator would be as
good as a Constitutional Amendment, making all backward
steps impossible.</p>

<p>I write now frankly, in reply to your inquiry, and
without any purpose of interfering in your election.
You will pardon my anxiety for the cause I have so
much at heart.</p>

<p>Accept my best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> wishes, and believe me, dear Sir,

<p>The Senate having under consideration the Bill for funding the National
Debt and for the Conversion of the Notes of the United States,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;After a tempest sweeping sea
and land, strewing the coast with wrecks, and
tumbling houses to the ground, Nature must become
propitious before the energy of man can repair the various
losses. Time must intervene. At last ships are
launched again, and houses are built, in larger numbers
and fairer forms than before. A tempest has swept over
us, scourging in every direction; and now that its violence
has ceased, we are occupied in the work of restoration.
Nature is already propitious, and time, too, is
silently preparing the way, while the national energies
are applied to the work.</p>

<p>To know what to do, we must comprehend the actual
condition of things, and how it was brought about. All
this is easy to see, if we will only look.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is a mistake of too constant occurrence to treat the
financial question by itself, without considering its dependence
upon the abnormal condition through which
the country has passed. The financial question, in all
its branches, depends upon the political, and cannot be
separated. I might use stronger language. It is a part
of the political question; and now that Reconstruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
seems about to be accomplished, it is that enduring part
which still remains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our present responsibilities, whether political or financial,
have a common origin in that vast Rebellion, when
the people of eleven States, maddened by Slavery, rose
against the Nation. As the Rebellion was without example
in its declared object, so it was without example
in the extent and intensity of its operations. It sought
nothing less than the dismemberment of our Nation and
the establishment of a new power with Slavery as its
quickening principle. The desperate means enlisted by
such a cause could be encountered only by the most
strenuous exertions in the name of Country and of Human
Rights. Here was Slavery, barbarous, brutal, vindictive,
warring for recognition. The tempest or tornado
can typify only feebly the ravage that ensued. There
were days of darkness and despair, when the national
existence was in peril. Rebel armies menaced the Capitol,
and Slavery seemed about to vindicate its wicked
supremacy.</p>

<p>Looking at the scene in its political aspects, we behold
one class of disorders, and looking at it in its financial
aspects, we behold still another,&mdash;both together
constituting a fearful sum-total, where financial disorder
mingles with political. Turn, first, to the political, and
you will see States, one after another, renouncing their
relations with the Nation, and constituting a new government,
under the name of Confederacy, with a new
Constitution, making Slavery its corner-stone,&mdash;all of
which they sought to maintain by arms, while, in aggravation
of these perils, Foreign Powers gave ominous
signs of speedy recognition and support. Look next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
to the financial side, and you will see business in some
places entirely prostrate, in others suddenly assuming
new forms; immense interests destroyed; property annihilated;
the whole people turned from the thoughts of
peace to the thoughts of war; vast armies set on foot, in
which the youthful and strong were changed from producers
to destroyers, while life itself was consumed; an
unprecedented taxation, commensurate with the unprecedented
exigency; and all this followed by the common
incidents of war in other countries and times,&mdash;first,
the creation of a national debt, and, secondly, the
substitution of inconvertible paper as a currency. In
this catalogue of calamities, political and financial, who
shall say which was the worst? Certainly it is difficult
to distinguish between them. One grew out of the other,
so that they belong together and constitute one group,
all derived ultimately from the Rebellion, and directly
depending upon it. So long as Slavery continued in
arms, each and all waxed in vastness; and now, so long
as any of these remain, they testify to this same unnatural
crime. The tax-gatherer, taking so much from
honest industry, was born of the Rebellion. Inconvertible
paper, deranging the business of the country at
home and abroad, had the same monstrous birth. Our
enormous taxation is only a prolongation of the Rebellion.
Every greenback is red with the blood of fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>To repair these calamities, political and financial, the
first stage was the overthrow of the Rebellion in the
field, thus enabling the Nation to reduce its armaments,
to arrest its accumulating debt, and to cease anxiety on
account of foreign intervention so constantly menaced.
Thus relieved, we were brought to a resting-place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the Nation found itself in condition to begin the work
of restoration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Foremost came the suppression of Slavery, in which
the Rebellion had its origin. Common prudence, to say
nothing of common humanity, required this consummation,
without which there would have been a short-lived
truce only. So great a change necessarily involved other
changes, while there was the ever-present duty to obtain
from the defeated Rebels, if not indemnity for the
past, at least security for the future. It was impossible
to stop with the suppression of Slavery. That whole
barbarous code of wrong and outrage, whose first article
was the denial of all rights to an oppressed race, was
grossly inconsistent with the new order of things. It
was necessary that it should yield to the Equal Rights
of All, promised by the Declaration of Independence.
The citizen, lifted from Slavery, must be secured in
all his rights, civil and political. Loyal governments,
republican in form, must be substituted for Rebel governments.
All this being done, the States, thus transformed,
will assume once more their ancient relations
to the Nation. This is the work of Political Reconstruction,
constituting the new stage after the overthrow
of the Rebellion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile there has been an effort and a longing
for Financial Reconstruction also,&mdash;sometimes without
sufficiently reflecting that there can be small chance
for any success in this direction until after Political
Reconstruction. Here also we must follow Nature,
and restore by removing the disturbing cause. This is
the natural process. Vain all attempt to reconst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ruct
the national finances while the Rebellion was still in
arms. This must be obvious to all. Vain also while
Slavery still domineered. Vain also while Equal
Rights are without a sure defence against the oppressor.
Vain also while the Nation still palpitates with
its efforts to obtain security for the future. Vain also
until the States are all once more harmonious in their
native spheres, like the planets, receiving and dispensing
light.</p>

<p>Nothing is more sensitive than Credit, which is the
essential element of financial restoration. A breath will
make it flutter. How can you expect to restore the national
credit, now unnaturally sensitive, while the Nation
is still uneasy from those Rebel pretensions which
have cost so much? Security is the first condition of
Financial Reconstruction; and I am at a loss to find any
road to it, except through Political Reconstruction. All
this seems so plain that I ought to apologize for dwelling
on it. And yet there are many, who, while professing
a desire for an improvement in our financial condition,
perversely turn their backs upon the only means
by which this can be accomplished. Never was there
equal folly. Language cannot picture it. Every denial
of Equal Rights, every impediment to a just reconstruction
in conformity with the Declaration of Independence,
every pretension of a “white man’s government”
in horrid mockery of self-evident truths declared
by our fathers, and of that brotherhood of mankind declared
by the Sermon on Mars Hill, is a bar to that
Financial Reconstruction without which the Rebellion
still lingers among us. So long as a dollar of irredeemable
paper is forced upon the country, the Rebellion
still lives, in its spurious progeny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Party organization and Presidential antagonism have
thus far stood in the way, while at each stage individual
perverseness has played its part. The President has set
himself obstinately against Political Reconstruction; so
also has the Democratic Party; others have followed,
according to the prejudices of their nature; and so the
national finances have suffered. Not the least of the
offences of Andrew Johnson is the adverse influence he
has exerted on this question. All that he has done from
the beginning has tended to protract the Rebellion and
to extend the disorder of our finances. And yet there
are many not indifferent to the latter who have looked
with indifference upon his criminal conduct. So far as
their personal interests depended on an improved condition
of the finances, they have already suffered; but
it is hard that the country should suffer also. Andrew
Johnson has postponed specie payments, and his supporters
of all degrees must share the responsibility.</p>

<p>Such is my confidence in the resources of our country,
in the industry of its people, and in the grandeur of its
destinies, that I cannot doubt the transcendent future.
Alas that it should be interrupted by unwise counsels,
even for a day! Financial Reconstruction is postponed
only. It must come at last. Here I have no panacea
that is not as simple as Nature. I know of no device
or trick or medicine by which this cure can be accomplished.
It will come with the general health of the
body politic. It will come with the renovated life of
the Nation, when it is once more complete in form,
when every part is in sympathy with the whole, and
the Rebellion, with all its offspring, is trampled out
forever. In such a condition of affairs, inconvertible
paper would be an impossibility, as much as a bill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
sale for a human being.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile there are certain practical points which
must not be forgotten. Foremost among these I put
the absolute dependence of the national finances upon
the faithful performance of all our obligations to the
national freedmen. Pardoned Rebels will never look
with complacency upon the national debt, or the interest
which testifies semiannually to its magnitude. Their
political colleagues at the North will be apt to sympathize
with them. Should the scales at any time hang
doubtful, it is to others that we must turn to adjust the
balance. Therefore, for the sake of the national finances,
I insist that the national freedmen shall be secured and
maintained in Equal Rights, so that local prejudices and
party cries shall be unavailing against them. You who
have at heart the national credit, on which so much depends,
must never fail to cherish the national freedmen,
treating their enemies as if they were your enemies.
Every blow at them will rebound upon yourselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In dealing with the financial question, there are two
other points of ever-present importance: first, the necessity
of diminishing, so far as practicable, the heavy
burden of taxation so oppressive to the people; and,
secondly, the necessity of substituting specie for inconvertible
paper. Here are two objects, which, when accomplished,
will add infinitely to the wealth and happiness
of the country, besides being the assurance that the
Nation has at last reached that condition of repose so
much longed for.</p>

<p>Before consideri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>ng these two points in detail, I venture
to remark that there is one condition, preliminary
in character and equally essential to both, through
which taxation will be lightened and specie payments
will be hastened. I refer to the Public Faith, which
must be sacredly preserved above all question or suspicion.
The word of our Nation must be as good as
its bond; and nobody must attempt to take a tittle
from either. Nothing short of universal wreck can
justify any such bankruptcy. Let the Public Faith be
preserved, and all that you now seek will be easy.</p>

<p>A virtuous king of early Rome dedicated a temple
on the Capitol Hill itself to a divinity under the name
of <i>Publica Fides</i>, who was represented with a wreath of
laurel about her head, carrying ears of corn and a basket
of fruit,&mdash;typical of honor and abundance sure to follow
in her footprints. In the same spirit another temple
was dedicated to the god Terminus, who presided
over boundaries. The stones set up to mark the limits
of estates were sacred, and on these very stones there
were religious offerings to the god. The heathen maledictions
upon the violator were echoed also by the Hebrews,
when they said: “Cursed be he that removeth
his neighbor’s landmark: and all the people shall say,
Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> In those early Roman and Hebrew days there
was no national debt divided into bonds; there was
nothing but land. But a national bond is as well defined
as a piece of land. Here, then, is a place for the
god Terminus. Every obligation is like a landmark,
not to be removed without curses. Here, also, is a place
for that other divinity, <i>Publica Fides</i>, with laurelled
head, and hands filled with corn and fruit.</p>

<p>Public Faith may be seen in the evil which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>springs
from its loss and in the good which overflows from its
preservation. It is like honor: and yet, once lost, more
than dishonor is the consequence; once assured, more
than honor is the reward. It is a possession surpassing
all others in value. The gold and silver in your Treasury
may be counted; it stands recorded, dollar for dollar,
in the national ledger; but the sums which the unsuspected
credit of a magnanimous nation can command
are beyond the record of any ledger. Public Faith is
more than mines of silver or gold. Only from Arabian
story can a fit illustration be found, as when, after all
human effort had failed, the Genius of the Lamp reared
the costly palace and stored it with beauty. Public
Faith is in itself a treasury, a tariff, and an internal
revenue, all in one. These you may lose; but if the
other is preserved, it will be only for a day. The Treasury
will be replenished, the tariff will be renewed, the
internal revenue will be restored. With Public Faith as
an unfailing law, the Nation, like Pactolus, will sweep
over golden sands; or, like Midas, it will change into
gold whatever it touches. Keep, then, the Public Faith
as the “open sesame” to all that you can desire; keep
it as you would keep the philosopher’s stone of fable,
having which, you have all.</p>

<p>And yet, in the face of this plain commandment, on
which hangs so much of all that is most prized in national
existence, we are called to break faith. It is proposed
to tax the national bonds, in violation of the original
bargain on which the money was lent. Sometimes
the tax is to be by the Nation, and sometimes by the
States. The power to do this wrong you may possess,
but the right never. Do what you will, there is one
thing you cannot do: you cannot make wrong right. It
is in vain that you undertake to set aside the perp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>etual
obligation which you have assumed. Against every
such pretension, whether by speech or vote, there is
this living duty, which will survive Congress and politician
alike. Puny as the hand of a child is the effort
to undo this original bargain. The Nation has promised
six per cent. interest, payable semiannually in coin, nor
more nor less, without any abatement; and then, having
bound itself, it proceeds to guard against the States by
declaring specifically that the bonds shall be “exempt
from taxation by or under State authority.” Such is the
bargain. There it is; and it must continue unchanged,
except by the consent of the parties, until the laws of
the universe tumble into chaos.</p>

<p>The rogue in Shakespeare exclaims, “What a fool
Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very simple
gentleman!” In equal levity it is said, “Tax the bonds,”
although, by the original bargain on which the money
was obtained, amid the trials of war for the safety of
the Nation, it was expressly stipulated that these bonds
should not be taxed. Nevertheless, tax the bonds! Of
course, by taxing the bonds the bargain is brutally
broken,&mdash;and this, too, after the Nation has used the
money. Such a transaction in common life, except
where bankruptcy had supervened, would be intolerable.
A proud Nation, justly sensitive to national honor,
as the great Republic through whose example liberal
institutions are commended to mankind, cannot do this
thing.</p>

<p>The proposition to tax the bonds, in open violation of
the original bargain, is similar in spirit to that other
enterprise, which, under various discordant ensigns, proposes
to pay the national bonds with inconvertible paper.
Here at once, and on the threshold, Public Faith interposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
a summary protest. On such a question debate
even is dangerous; the man who doubts is lost. The
money was borrowed and lent on the undoubting faith
that it was to be paid in coin. Nothing to the contrary
was suggested, imagined, or dreamed, at the time. Behind
all forms of language, and even all omissions, this
obligation stands forth, in the nature of the case, explained
and confirmed by the history of our national
loans, and by the official acts of successive Secretaries of
the Treasury interpreting the obligations of the Nation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So much stress is laid upon the language of the five-twenties
that I cannot let it pass. The terms employed
were precisely those in previous bonds of the United
States where the principal was paid in coin, some of
which are still outstanding. Had there been any doubt
about the meaning, it was fixed by the general understanding,
and by special declarations of responsible persons
speaking for the Nation. On 26th May, 1863, Mr.
Harrington, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, in
an official letter, says: “These bonds will, therefore, be
paid in gold.” On 15th February, 1864, Mr. Field, also
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, writes: “I am directed
by the Secretary to say that it is the purpose
of the Government to pay said bonds, like other bonds
of the United States, in coin, at maturity.” On 18th
May, 1864, Mr. Chase, at the time Secretary of the
Treasury, wrote: “These bonds, <i>according to the usage
of the Government</i>, are payable in coin.” Mr. Fessenden,
while Secretary of the Treasury, in his annual report to
Congress, expressed the same conclusion; and his successor,
Mr. McCulloch, in a letter of 15th November, 1866,
says: “I regard, as did also my predecessors, all bonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
of the United States as payable in coin.” There are also
numerous advertisements from the Treasury, and from
its business agents, all in the same sense.</p>

<p>Here is a succession of authorities, embracing high
functionaries of the United States, all concurring in
affixing upon these bonds the obligation to pay in coin.
As testimony to the meaning of the bonds, it is important;
but considering that all these persons represented
the National Treasury, and that they were the agents of
the Nation for the sale of these very bonds, their representations
are more than testimony. Until their authority
is disowned by Congress, and their representations
discarded, it is difficult to see why their language must
not be treated as part of the contract, at least in all sales
subsequent to its publication. It must not be forgotten
that these original sales were mainly to bankers and
brokers, and in large amounts, for the purpose of resale
to small purchasers seeking investments. It was in reply
to parties interested in these resales that the letters
of Assistant Secretary Field and Mr. Chase were written,
pledging the Nation to payment in coin. At the date
of these important letters Congress was in session, and,
although the opportunity was constant, there was no
protest against the meaning thus authoritatively affixed
to these obligations. The bonds were in the market, advertised
and sold daily, with a value established by the
representations of these national agents; and Congress
did not interfere to set aside these representations. By
subsequent Acts similar loans were authorized, and nobody
protested. There was the supplementary clause of
3d March, 1864, for the issue of eleven millions of these
bonds, to cover an excess subscribed above the amount
authorized by the original Act. This was debated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Senate on the 1st of March; but you will search the
“Globe” in vain for any protest. Then came other Acts,
at different dates, by which the loan was further enlarged
to its present extent, and all the time these representations
were uncontradicted. Against them there
was no Act of Congress, no protest, nothing. If this is
not “acquiescence,” then I am at a loss to know how
acquiescence can be shown. Therefore do I insist that
these representations are a part of the contract by which
the Nation is bound.</p>

<p>It is said that in the five-twenty bonds there are
words promising interest in coin, but nothing with regard
to the principal. Forgetting the contemporary
understanding and the official interpretation, and assuming
that at maturity the bond is no better than a
greenback, it becomes important to know the character
of this obligation. On its face a greenback is a promise
to pay a certain number of dollars. It is paper, and it
promises to pay “dollars.” Here is an example, which I
take from my pocket: “The United States promise to pay
to the bearer <i>five dollars</i>”&mdash;not five dollars in paper,
or in some other substituted promise, but “five dollars,”
which can mean nothing else than the coin known over
the world with the stamp of Spain, Mexico, and the
United States, being a fixed value, which passes current
in every zone and at the antipodes. The “dollar” is an
established measure of value, like the five-franc piece of
France, or the pound sterling of England. As well say,
that, on a promise to pay so many francs in France, or
so many pounds sterling in England, you could honestly
acquit yourself by handing over a scrap of printed paper,
inconvertible in value. This could not be done. The
promise in our greenbacks carries with it an ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
obligation to pay the silver dollar whose chink is so familiar
in the commerce of the world. The convertibility
of the greenback is for the present suspended; but when
paid, it must be in coin. To pay with another promise
is to renew, and not to discharge the debt. But the obligation
in our bonds is to pay “dollars” also, <i>whenever
the bonds are paid</i>; it may be after five years, or, in the
discretion of the Nation, not till twenty years, but, <i>when
paid</i>, it must be in “dollars.” Such is the stipulation;
nor could the addition of “coin” or “gold” essentially
change this obligation. <i>It is contrary to reason that a
bond should be paid in an inferior obligation.</i> It is dishonest
to force inconvertible paper without interest in
payment of an interest-bearing obligation. The statement
of the case is enough. Such an attempt disturbs
the reason and shocks the moral sense.</p>

<p>Between the bond and the greenback there is an obvious
distinction, doubly attested by the Act of Congress
creating them both,&mdash;for they were created together.
This distinction appears, first, in the title of the Act,
and, secondly, in its provisions. According to its title,
it is “An Act to authorize the issue of United States
notes, <i>and for the redemption or funding thereof, and
for funding the floating debt of the United States</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> In
brief, greenbacks were made a legal tender, and authority
was given to fund them in these bonds. This appears
in the very title of the Act. Now the object of funding
is to bring what is uncertain and floating into a permanent
form; and accordingly greenbacks were funded
and placed on interest. The bonds were a substitute for
the greenbacks; but the new theory makes the greenbacks
a substitute for the bonds. To carry forward still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
further the policy of the Act, it was provided that the
greenbacks might be exchanged at once for bonds; and
then, by the Act of 11th July, 1862,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> it was further
provided that these very greenbacks “may be paid in
coin,” at the direction of the Secretary, instead of being
received in exchange for certificates of deposit, which
were convertible into bonds,&mdash;thus treating the bonds
as the equivalent of coin. The subsequent repeal of
these provisions does not alter their testimony to the
character of these bonds. Thus, at every turn, we are
brought to the same conclusion. The dishonor of these
obligations, whatever form it may assume, and whatever
pretext it may adopt, is nothing but Repudiation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The word <i>Repudiation</i>, now so generally used to denote
the refusal to pay national obligations, has been
known in this sense only recently. In the early dictionaries
of our language it had no such signification.
According to Dr. Johnson, it meant simply “divorce,”
“rejection,” as when a man put away his wife. It began
to be known in its present sense when Mississippi, the
State of Jefferson Davis, dishonored her bonds. From
that time the word has been too familiar in our public
discussions. It was not unnatural that a State mad with
Slavery should dishonor its bonds. Rejecting all obligations
of humanity and justice, it easily rejected the obligations
of Public Faith. Slavery was in itself a perpetual
<i>repudiation</i>, and slave-masters were unblushing
<i>repudiators</i>. Such an example is not fit for our Nation
at this great period of its history.</p>

<p>It is one of the calamities of war, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>that, while it compels
the employment of large means, it blunts the moral
sense, and breeds too frequently an insensibility to the
obligations incurred. A national debt shares for the
time the exceptional character of war itself. Contracted
hastily, it is little regarded except as a burden. At last,
when business is restored and all things assume their
natural proportions, it is recognized in its true character.
The country accommodates itself to the pressure.
This time is now at hand among us, if not arrested by
disturbing influences. Unhappily, the demands of Public
Faith are met by higgling and chaffering, and we are
gravely reminded that the “bloated bond-holders” now
expect more than they gave,&mdash;forgetting that they gave
in the darkness of the war, at the appeal of the Nation,
and to keep those armies in the field through which its
existence was preserved,&mdash;forgetting also that among
these bond-holders, now so foully stigmatized, were the
poor, as well as the rich, all giving according to their
means. It was not in the ordinary spirit of money-lending
that those contributions were made. Love of country
entered into them, and made them more than money.
If the interest was considerable, it was only in proportion
to the risk. Every loan at that time was a contract
of bottomry on the Nation,&mdash;like money lent to a ship
in a strange port, and conditioned on its arrival safe at
home,&mdash;so that it failed entirely, if Slavery, by the aid
of Foreign Powers, established its supremacy. God be
praised, the enemy has been overcome! It remains now
that we should overcome that other enemy, which, hardly
less malignant than war itself, would despoil the Nation
of its good name and take from it all the might of
honesty. And here to every citizen, and especially to
every legislator, I would address those incomparable
words of Milton in his sonnet to Fairfax:&mdash;</p>

<p>The proposition to pay bonds in greenbacks becomes
futile and fatuous, when it is considered that such an
operation would be nothing more than the substitution
of greenbacks for bonds, and not a payment of anything.
The form of the debt would be changed, but the debt
would remain. Of the twenty-five hundred millions
which we now owe, whether in greenbacks or bonds,
every dollar must be paid, sooner or later, or be ignobly
repudiated. By paying the interest of the bonds in
coin, instead of greenbacks, the annual increase of the
debt to this extent is prevented. But the principal remains
to be paid. If this be attempted in greenbacks, it
will be by an issue far beyond all the demands of the
currency. There will be a deluge of greenbacks. The
country must suffer inconceivably under such a dispensation.
The interest on the bonds may be stopped by
the substitution, but the currency will be depreciated
infinitely beyond any such dishonest saving. The country
will be bankrupt. Inconvertible paper will overspread
the land, to the exclusion of coin or any chance
of coin for some time to come. Farewell then to specie
payments! Greenbacks will be everywhere. The multitudinous
rats that swam the Rhine and devoured
Bishop Hatto in his tower were not more destructive.
The cloud of locusts described by Milton as “warping
on the eastern wind” and “darkening all the land of
Nile,” were not more pestilential.</p>

<p>I am now brought to the practical <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>question, to which
I have already alluded: How the public burdens shall
be lightened. Of course, in this work, the Public Faith,
if kept sacred, will be a constant and omnipresent agency,
powerful in itself, and powerful also in its reinforcement
of all other agencies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will not seem trivial, if I insist on systematic
economy in the administration of the Government. All
needless expenditure must be lopped off. Our swollen
appropriations must be compressed. Extravagance and
recklessness, so natural during a period of war, must
give way to moderation and thrift. All this without
any denial of what is just or beneficent. The rule should
be economy without niggardliness. Always there must
be a good reason for whatever we spend. Every dollar,
as it leaves the National Treasury, must be able to exhibit
its passport. Doubtless the army and navy can
be further reduced without detriment to the public service.
Beyond this great saving there should be a constant
watchfulness against those schemes of public plunder,
great and small, from which the Nation has latterly
suffered so much. All these things are so plain as to
be little more than truisms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another help will be found in the simplification of
our system of taxation, so that it shall be less complex
and shall apply to fewer objects. In Europe taxation
has become a science, according to which the largest
possible amounts are obtained at the smallest possible
inconvenience. Instead of sweeping through all the
highways and byways of life, leaving no single thing
unvisited, the English system has a narrow range and
visits a few select articles only. I see no reason why
we should not profit by this example, much to the co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>nvenience
of the Government and of the citizen. The
tax-gatherer will never be a very welcome guest, but he
may be less of an intruder than now. A proper tax on
two articles, whiskey and tobacco, with proper securities
for its collection, would go far to support the Government.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Still another agency will be found in some proper
scheme for a diminution of the interest on our national
debt, so far as this can be done without a violation of
Public Faith; and this brings me to the very bill now
before the Senate.</p>

<p>All are anxious to relieve the country from recurring
liabilities, which come round like the seasons. How
can this be done best? First, by the strict performance
of all existing engagements, so that the Public Faith
shall be our inseparable ally; and, secondly, by funding
the existing debt in such ways as to provide a reduced
rate of interest. A longer term would justify a smaller
interest. There may be differences as to the form of the
substitute, but it would seem as if something of this
kind must be done.</p>

<p>Immediately after the close of the war, as the smoke
of battle was disappearing, but before the national ledger
was sufficiently examined to justify a comparison between
liabilities and resources, there was a generous
inclination to proceed at once to the payment of the
national debt. Volunteers came forward with their contributions
for this purpose, in the hope that the generation
which suppressed the Rebellion might have the
added glory of removing this great burden. This ardor
was momentary. It was soon seen that the task was too
extensive, and that it justly belonged to another gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>eration,
with aggrandized population and resources, in presence
of which the existing debt, large to us, would be
small. Here the census has its instructive lesson. According
to the rate of increase in past years, our population
will advance in the following proportion:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Population" class="small">
  <tr>
    <td>In 1870,</td><td class="tdr">42,323,341</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In 1910,</td><td class="tdr">138,918,526</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The resources of the country, already so vast, will
swell in still larger proportions. Population increasing
beyond example, improved systems of communication
expanding in every direction, and the mechanical arts
with their infinite activities old and new,&mdash;all these
must carry the Nation forward beyond any present calculation,
so that the imagination tires in the effort to
grasp the mighty result. Therefore to the future we
may tranquilly leave the final settlement of the national
debt, meanwhile discharging our own incidental duty,
so that the Public Faith shall be preserved.</p>

<p>Here is a notable difference between the United
States and other countries, where population and resources
have arrived at such a point that future advance
is very gradual. With us each decade is a leap forward;
with them it marks a gradation sometimes scarcely appreciable.
This difference must not be forgotten in the
estimate of our capacity to deal with a debt larger than
that of any European power except England. But we
must confess our humiliation, as we find that our debt,
with its large interest in coin, secured by mortgage on
the immeasurable future of the Nation, is less regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
abroad than the English debt, with its smaller interest
and its more limited security. Our sixes will command
only seventy-four per cent. in the market of London,
while the three per cent. consols of England are freely
bought at ninety-four per cent. One of our bonds brings
twenty per cent. less than an English bond, although the
interest on it is one hundred per cent. more. I know
no substantial reason for this enormous difference, except
in the superior credit established by England.
With the national credit above suspicion, our debt must
stand as well, and, as our multiplying resources become
known, even better still. Thus constantly are we brought
to the same lesson of Public Faith.</p>

<p>In spite of the general discredit of our national stocks
abroad, Massachusetts fives payable in 1894 sell at the
nominal price of 84, with the pound sterling at $4.44,
equal to 91½ in our gold, with the pound sterling at
$4.83. There can be no other reason for this higher
price than the superior credit enjoyed by Massachusetts;
and thus again is Public Faith exalted. Why should
not the Nation, with its infinite resources, surpass Massachusetts?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The bill before us proposes a new issue of bonds, redeemable
in coin after twenty, thirty, and forty years,
with interest at five per cent., four and one half per
cent., and four per cent., in coin, exempt from State or
municipal taxation, and also from national taxation, except
the general tax on income,&mdash;these bonds to be
used exclusively for the conversion of an equal amount
of the interest-bearing debt of the United States, except
the existing five per cent. bonds and the three per cent.
certificates. These proposed bonds have the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of being explicit in their terms. The obligations of the
Government are fixed clearly and unchangeably beyond
the assaults of politicians.</p>

<p>A glance at the national debt will show the operation
of this measure. The sum-total on the 1st of February,
1868, according to the statement from the Treasury, was
$2,514,315,373, being, in round numbers, twenty-five
hundred millions. Out of this may be deducted legal-tender
and fractional notes, as currency, amounting to
$388,405,565, and several other smaller items. The following
amounts represent the portions of debt provided
for by this bill:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Debt" class="small">
  <tr>
    <td class="hanging">Six per cent., due 1881,</td><td class="tdr">$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;283,676,600</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="hanging">Six per cent., five-twenties,</td><td class="tdr">1,398,488,850</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="hanging">Seven and three tenths Treasury notes, convertible into five-twenty bonds at maturity,</td><td class="tdr">214,953,850</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td><td class="tdr total">$1,897,119,300</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This considerable sum may be funded under the proposed
bill.</p>

<p>If this large portion of the national debt, with its six
per cent. interest in coin, can be funded at a less interest,
there will be a corresponding relief to the country.
But there is one way only in which this can be
successfully accomplished. It is by making the Public
Faith so manifest that the holders will be induced to
come into the change for the sake of the longer term.
All that is done by them must be voluntary. Every
holder must be free to choose. He may prefer his
short bond at six per cent., or a long bond at five per
cent., or a longer at four and one half per cent., or a
still longer at four per cent. This is his affair. Ther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>e
must be no compulsion. Any menace of compulsion
will defeat the transaction. It will be nothing less than
Repudiation, with a certain loss of credit, which no saving
of interest can repay. You must continue to borrow
on a large scale; but who will lend to the repudiator,
unless at a destructive discount? Any reduction of
interest without the consent of the holders will reduce
your capacity to borrow. A forced reduction of interest
will be like a forced loan. While seeming to save interest,
you will lose capital. Do not be deceived. Any
compulsory conversion is only another form of Repudiation.
It is tantamount to this declared crime. It is the
same misdeed, taking still another shape,&mdash;as Proteus
was the same heathen god in all his various transformations.
It is Repudiation under an <i>alias</i>.</p>

<p>Happily the bill before us is free from any such damning
imputation. The new bonds are authorized; but the
holders of existing obligations are left free to exercise
their judgment in making the change. I am assured by
those who, from practical acquaintance with business,
ought to know, that these bonds will be rapidly taken
for the five-twenties.</p>

<p>The same bill, in its second section, sets apart
$135,000,000 annually to the payment of the interest
and the reduction of the principal of the national debt;
and this is to be in lieu of a sinking fund. This is an
additional security. It is another assurance of our determination
to deal honestly.</p>

<p>The third section of the same bill is newer in its provisions,
and, perhaps, more open to doubt. But, though
uncertain with regard to it in the beginning, I have
found that it commended itself on careful examination.
On its face it provides for a system of conversion a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>nd
reconversion. The holder of lawful money to the amount
of $1,000, or any multiple of $1,000, may convert the
same into the funded debt for an equal amount; and
any holder of the funded debt may receive for the same
at the Treasury lawful money, unless the notes then
outstanding shall be equal to $400,000,000. If bonds
in the funded debt shall be worth more than greenbacks,
the latter would be converted into bonds according to
the ordinary laws of trade. The latest relation of these
two is as follows: $100 greenbacks equal seventy-one
dollars gold; $100 five per cent. equal seventy-six dollars
gold. If the greenbacks are convertible into the
five per cent., they will, of course, be converted while
the above relation continues. This must be so long as
the national credit is maintained abroad and the demand
for our securities continues there. By this process our
greenbacks will be gradually absorbed, and those that
are not absorbed will be lifted in value. It would seem
as if bonds and greenbacks must both gain from this
business, and with them the country must gain also.
Here would be a new step to specie payments.</p>

<p>The bill closes with a provision authorizing contracts
in coin, instead of greenbacks, according to the agreement
of parties. This authority is in harmony with the
other provisions of the bill, and is still another step toward
specie payments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am now brought to the last branch of this discussion,
in which all the others are absorbed: I mean the
necessity of specie payments, or, in other words, the
necessity of coin in the place of inconvertible paper.
Other things are means to this end: this is the end itself.
Until this is accomplished, Financial Reconstruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
exists in aspiration only, and not in reality.</p>

<p>The suspension of specie payments was originally a
war measure, like the suspension of the <i>Habeas Corpus</i>.
It was so declared by myself at the time it was authorized.
Pardon me, if I quote my own words in the debate
on the bill:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a discretion kindred to that under which the <i>Habeas
Corpus</i> is suspended, so that citizens are arrested without
the forms of law,&mdash;kindred to that under which an extensive
territory is declared to be in a condition of insurrection,
so that all business with its inhabitants is suspended,&mdash;kindred
to that, which unquestionably exists, to obtain soldiers,
if necessary, by draft or conscription instead of the free
offering of volunteers,&mdash;kindred to that under which private
property is taken for public uses,&mdash;and kindred, also, to that
undoubted discretion which sanctions the completest exercise
of the transcendent right of self-defence.”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As a war measure, it should cease with the war, or so
soon thereafter as practicable. It should not be continued
a day beyond positive exigency. While the war
lasted, it was a necessity, as the war itself. Its continuance
now prolongs into peace this belligerent agency,
and projects its disturbing influence into the most distant
places. Like war, whose greatest engine it was, it
is the cause of incalculable evil. Like war, it troubles
the entire Nation, deranges business, and demoralizes the
people. As I hate war, so do I hate all its incidents, and
long to see them disappear. Already in these remarks I
have pictured the financial anarchy of our country, the
natural reflection of the political; but the strongest illustration
is in a disordered currency, which is present
to everybody with a dollar in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>The derangement of business may be seen at home
and abroad. It is not merely derangement; it is dislocation.
Everything is out of joint. Business has its disease
also, showing itself in opposite conditions: shrunk
at times, as with paralysis; swollen at times to unhealthy
proportions, as with <i>elephantiasis</i>. The first
condition of business is stability, which is only another
form of security; but this is impossible, when nobody
can tell from day to day the value of the currency. It
may change in a night. The reasonable contract of to-day
may become onerous beyond calculation to-morrow.
There is no fixed standard. The seller is afraid to sell,
the buyer afraid to buy. Nobody can sell or buy a farm,
nobody can build or mortgage a house, except at an unnatural
hazard. Salaries and all fixed incomes suffer.
The pay of every soldier in the army, every sailor in the
navy, every office-holder from the President to the humblest
postmaster, is brought under this tyrannical influence.
Harder still, innocent pensioners, wards of the
Nation, must bear the same doom. Maimed soldiers,
bereaved widows, helpless orphans, whose cup is already
full, are compelled to see their scanty dole shrink before
their sight till it seems ready to vanish in smoke.</p>

<p>A greenback is a piece of paper with a promise on its
face and green on its back, declared to be money by Act
of Congress, but which the Government refuses to pay.
It is “failed paper” of the Government. The mischief
of such a currency is everywhere, enveloping the whole
country and penetrating all its parts. It covers all and
enters all. It is a discredit to the national name, from
which the Nation suffers in whole and in detail. It
weakens the Nation and hampers the citizen. There is
no national enterprise which it does not impede. Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>e
Pacific Railroad feels it. There is not a manufacture or
business which does not feel it also. There is not a town,
or village, or distant place, which it does not visit.</p>

<p>A practical instance will show one way in which individuals
suffer on an extensive scale, being generally
those who are least able. I follow an ingenious merchant,
Mr. Atkinson, of Boston, whose figures sustain his
conclusion, when I insist that our present currency, from
its unstable character, operates as an <i>extra</i> tax of more
than one hundred millions annually on the labor and
business of the country; and this vast sum is taken
from the pockets of the people, not for the support of
the Government, but to swell the unreported fund out
of which the excesses of the present day are maintained.
There are few business men who would not put the annual
loss in their affairs, from the fluctuation in the currency,
somewhere from one to five per cent. One per
cent. is the lowest. Mr. Hazard, of Rhode Island, puts
it at two per cent. Now the aggregate sales in the fiscal
year ending June, 1867, were over eleven thousand millions
($11,000,000,000) in currency, excluding sales of
stocks or bonds. One per cent. on this prodigious amount
represents a tax of one hundred and ten millions, paid
annually by consumers, according to their consumption,
and not in any degree according to their ability. This is
one instance only of the damages annually paid on account
of our currency. If we estimate the annual tax at
more than one per cent., the sum-total will be proportionally
larger. Even at the smallest rate, it is many
millions more than all the annual expenses of our Government
immediately preceding the Rebellion.</p>

<p>Fluctuations in the measure of value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> are as inconvenient
and fatal as fluctuations in the measures of length
and bulk. A dollar which has to-day one value and
to-morrow another is no better than a yard which has
to-day one length and another to-morrow, or a bushel
which has to-day one capacity and another to-morrow.
It is as uncertain as “Equity” measured by the varying
foot of successive chancellors, sometimes long and sometimes
short, according to the pleasant illustration of Selden
in his “Table-Talk.” Such fluctuations are more
than a match for any prudence. Business is turned into
a guess, or a game of hazard, where the prevailing anarchy
is overruled by accident:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In such a condition of things the gamblers have the
advantage. The stock exchange becomes little better
than a faro bank. By such scenes the country is demoralized.
The temptation of excessive gains leads from the
beaten path of business. Speculation without money
takes the place of honest industry, extending from the
stock exchange everywhere. The failed paper of the
Government teaches the lesson of bankruptcy. The
Government refuses to take up its notes, and others
do likewise. These things cannot be without a shock
to public morals. Honesty ceases to be even a policy.
Broken contracts prepare the way for crime, which
comes to complete the picture.</p>

<p>Our foreign commerce is not less disturbed; for here
we are brought within the sphere of other laws than our
own. Gold is the standard of business throughout the
civilized world. Until it becomes again the standard
among us, we are not, according to the familiar phra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>se
of President Lincoln, in “practical relation” with the
civilized world. We are States out of the great Union.
Our currency has the stamp of legality at home, but it
is worthless abroad. In all foreign transactions we are
driven to purchase gold at a premium, or to adopt a system
of barter which belongs to the earlier stages of commerce.
Corn, wheat, and cotton are exchanged for the
products we desire, and this traffic is the coarse substitute
for that refined and plastic system of exchanges
which adapts itself so easily to all the demands of business.
Commerce with foreign powers is prosecuted at
an incalculable disadvantage. Our shipping, which in
times past has been the pride of the Nation, whitening
every sea with its sails, is reduced in number and value.
Driven from the ocean by pirate flags during the Rebellion,
it cannot struggle back to its ancient supremacy
until the accustomed laws of trade once more resume
their rule.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are few who will deny the transcendent evil
which I have set forth. There are few who will advocate
inconvertible paper as currency. How shall the
remedy be applied? On this question, so interesting to
the business and good name of the country, there are
theories without number,&mdash;some so ingenious as to be
artificial rather than natural. What is natural is simple;
and I am persuaded that our remedy must be of
this character.</p>

<p>The legal-tender note, which we wish to expel from
our currency, has two different characters: first, as mere
currency, for use in the transactions of business; and,
secondly, as real value, from the assurance that ultimately
it will be paid in coin, according to its promise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
These two different characters may be sententiously expressed
as <i>availability</i> and <i>convertibility</i>. The notes are
now available without being convertible. Our desire is
to make them convertible,&mdash;in other words, the equivalent
of coin in value, dollar for dollar. On the 1st
of June last past these notes were $388,675,802 in
amount.</p>

<p>Discarding theories, however ingenious, and following
Nature, I call attention to a few practical points, before
reverting to those cardinal principles applicable to this
subject, from which there can be no appeal.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The present proposition for funding is an excellent
measure for this purpose, being at once simple
and practical: not that it contains any direct promise
for the redemption of our currency, but because it places
the national debt on a permanent footing at a smaller
interest than is now paid. By this change three things
essential to financial reconstruction are promoted: economy,
stability, and national credit. With these once
established, specie payments cannot be long postponed.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> Another measure of immediate value is <i>the
legalization of contracts in coin</i>, so that henceforth all
agreements made in coin may be legally enforced in coin
or its equivalent. This would establish specie payments
wherever parties desired, and to this extent begin the
much-desired change. Contracts in coin would increase
and multiply, until the exception became the rule. There
would for a time be <i>two currencies</i>; but the better must
gradually prevail. The essential equity of the new system
would be apparent, while there would be a charm
in once more looking upon familiar faces long hidden
from sight, as the hoarded coin came forth. Nor can any
possible injury ensue. The legalization is applicabl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>e
only to future contracts, as the parties mutually agree.
Every citizen in this respect would be a law to himself.
If he chose in his own business to resume specie payments,
he could do so. There would be a voluntary resumption
by the people, one by one. But this influence
could not be confined to the immediate parties. Beyond
the contagion of its example, there would be a positive
necessity on the part of the banks that they should
adapt themselves to the exigency by the substitution of
proper commercial equivalents; and thus again we take
another step in specie payments.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> Another measure of practical value is <i>the
contraction of the existing currency</i>, so as to bring it on a
par with coin, dollar for dollar. Before alluding to any
of the expedients to accomplish this precious object, it
is important to arrive at some idea of the amount of
currency of all kinds required for the business of the
country. To do this, we may look at the currency before
the Rebellion, when business was in its normal condition.
I shall not occupy space with tables, although
they are now before me, but content myself with results.
From the official report of the Treasury it appears that
on the 1st of January, 1860, the whole active circulation
of the country, including bank circulation, bank deposits
available as currency, specie in bank, specie in
Treasury, estimated specie in circulation, and deducting
reserves, amounted to $542,097,264. It may be assumed
that this sum-total was the amount of currency required
at the time. From the same official tables it appears
that on the 1st of October, 1867, the whole active circulation
of the country, beginning with greenbacks and
fractional currency, and including all the items in the
other account, amounted to $1,245,138,193. Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>us from
1860, when the currency was normal, to 1867, some
time after the suspension of specie payments, there
was an increase of one hundred and thirty per cent.
Omitting bank deposits for both years, the increase was
one hundred and forty-six per cent. Making due allowance
for the increase of population, business, and
Government transactions, there remains a considerable
portion of this advance which must be attributed to the
abnormal condition of the currency. I follow various
estimates in putting this at sixty or seventy per cent.,
representing the difference of prices at the two different
periods, and the corresponding excess of currency
above the requirements of the country. Therefore, for
the reduction of prices, there must be a reduction of
the currency; and this must be to the amount of
$300,000,000. So it seems, unless these figures err.</p>

<p>Against the movement for contraction, which is commended
by its simplicity and its tendency to a normal
condition of things, we have two adverse policies,&mdash;one,
the stand-still policy, and the other, worse yet, the policy
of inflation. By the first the currency is left <i>in statu
quo</i>,&mdash;stationary,&mdash;subject to the influence of other
conditions, which may operate to reduce it. Better stand
still than move in a wrong direction. By the latter the
currency is enlarged at the expense of the people,&mdash;being
at once a tax and a derangement of values. You
pamper the morbid appetite for paper money, and play
the discarded part of John Law. You blow up a bladder,
without thinking that it is nothing but a bladder,
ready to burst. As the volume of currency is increased,
the purchasing power of each dollar is reduced in proportion.
As you add to the currency, you take from
the dollar. You do little more than mark your goods at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
higher prices, and imagine that they have increased in
value. Already the price is too high. Do not make it
higher. Already the currency is corrupted. Do not corrupt
it more. The cream has been reduced to skimmed
milk. Do not let it be reduced to chalk and water. Let
there be national cream for all the people.</p>

<p>Obviously any contraction of the currency must be
conducted with caution, so as to interfere as little as
possible with existing interests. It should be understood
in advance, so that business may adapt itself to
the change. Once understood, it must be pursued wisely
to the end. I call attention to a few of the expedients
by which this contraction may be made.</p>

<p>1. Any holder may have liberty to fund his greenbacks
in bonds, as he may desire; so that, as coin increases,
they will be merged in the funded debt, and
the currency be reduced in corresponding proportion.</p>

<p>2. Greenbacks, when received at the Treasury, may be
cancelled, or they may be redeemed directly, so far as
the coin on hand will permit.</p>

<p>3. Greenbacks may be converted into compound-interest
notes, to be funded in monthly instalments,
running over a term of years, thus reaching specie payments
within a brief period.</p>

<p>4. Another expedient, more active still, is the application
of the coin on hand to the payment of greenbacks
at a given rate,&mdash;say $6,000,000 a month,&mdash;selecting
for payment those holders who present the largest
amount of five-twenties for conversion into the long
bonds at a low rate of interest, or shall pay the highest
premium on such bonds.</p>

<p>I mention these as exp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>edients, having the authority
of financial names, calculated to operate in the same
direction, without violent change or spasmodic action.
Under their mild and beneficent influence the currency
would be gradually reduced, so that the final step, when
taken, would be hardly felt. With so great an object in
view, I do not doubt its accomplishment at an early
day, if the Nation only wills it. “Where there is a will,
there is a way”; and never was this proverb truer than
on this occasion. To my mind it is clear, that, when the
Nation wills a currency in coin, then must this victory
over the Rebellion be won,&mdash;provided always that there
is no failure in those other things on which I have also
dwelt as the <i>conditions precedent</i> of this final victory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How vain it is to expect Financial Reconstruction until
Political Reconstruction has been completed I have
already shown. How vain to expect specie payments
until the Nation has once more gained its natural vigor,
and it has become <i>one</i> in reality as in name! Let this
be, and the Nation will be like a strong man, in the full
enjoyment of all his forces, coping with the trials of
life.</p>

<p>There must also be peace within our borders, so that
there shall be no discord between President and Congress.
Therefore, so long as Andrew Johnson is President,
the return to specie payments is impossible. So
long as a great party, called Democratic, better now
called Rebel, wars on that Political Reconstruction which
Congress has organized, there can be no specie payments.
So long as any President, or any political party,
denies the Equal Rights of the freedman, it is vain to
expect specie payments. Whoso would have equity
must do equity; and now, if you would have specie
payments, you must do this great equity. The re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>st will
follow. When General Grant said, “Let us have peace,”
he said also, “Let us have specie payments.” Among
all the blessed gifts of peace there is none more certain.</p>

<p>Nor must it be forgotten that there can be no departure
in any way from the requirements of Public Faith.
This is a perpetual obligation, complete in all respects,
and just as applicable to the freedman as to the bond-holder.
Repudiation in all its forms, direct or indirect,
whether of the freedman or the bond-holder, must be repudiated.
The freedman and bond-holder are under the
same safeguard, and there is the same certain disaster
from any repudiation of either. Unless the Public Faith
is preserved inviolate, you cannot fund your debt at a
smaller interest, you cannot convert your greenbacks,
you cannot comply with the essential terms of Reconstruction.
Amid all surrounding abundance you are
poor and powerless, for you are dishonored. Do not say,
as an apology, that all should have the same currency.
True as this may be, it is a cheat, when used to cover
dishonor. The currency of all should be coin, and you
should lift all the national creditors to this solid platform
rather than drag a single citizen down. A just
Equality is sought by levelling up instead of levelling
down. In this way the national credit will be maintained,
so that it will be a source of wealth, prosperity,
and renown.</p>

<p>Pardon me, if now, by way of recapitulation, I call
your attention to three things in which all others centre.
The first is the <i>Public Faith</i>. The second is the
<i>Public Faith</i>. The third is the <i>Public Faith</i>. Let these
be sacredly preserved, and there is nothing of power or
fame which can be wanting. All things will pay tribute
to you, even from the uttermost parts of the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
All the sheaves will stand about, as in the dream of
Joseph, and make obeisance to your sheaf. Good people,
especially all concerned in business, whether commerce,
banking, or labor, our own compatriots or the people of
other lands, will honor and uphold the nation which,
against all temptation, keeps its word.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate had under consideration the Bill concerning the Rights
of American Citizens in Foreign States, which had already passed the
House of Representatives. As it came from the House it contained
the following section:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That, whenever it shall be duly
made known to the President that any citizen of the United States has
been arrested and is detained by any foreign Government, in contravention
of the intent and purposes of this Act, upon the allegation that
naturalization in the United States does not operate to dissolve his allegiance
to his native sovereign, or if any citizen shall have been arrested
and detained, whose release upon demand shall have been unreasonably
delayed or refused, <i>the President shall be, and hereby is, empowered to
suspend, in part or wholly, commercial relations with the said Government,
or, in case no other remedy is available, to order the arrest and to
detain in custody any subject or citizen of such foreign Government who
may be found within the jurisdiction of the United States, and who has
not declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, except
ambassadors and other public ministers and their domestics and domestic
servants; and the President shall without delay give information
to Congress of any proceedings under this Act</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner reported an amendment, to strike out the words in
Italic authorizing the suspension of commercial relations and reprisals
on persons, and substitute therefor these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It shall be the duty of the President forthwith to report to Congress
all the circumstances of any such arrest and detention, and any proceedings
for the release of the citizen so arrested and detained, that Congress
may take prompt action to secure to every citizen of the United States
his just rights.”</p>

</div>

<p>On this amendment Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Before entering upon this discussion,
I wish to read a brief telegram, which
came by the cable last evening, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>July 17</i>.&mdash;In the House, last evening, Stanley,
the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, made an important statement
in answer to a question asking for information. In
reply, he said he had already sent to the United States Government
a note on the matter of Naturalization, the substance
of which was, that the British ministry was ready to accept
the American views of the question. He therefore thought a
misunderstanding between the two nations impossible.”</p>

</div>

<p>Add to this important information the well-known
fact, that the United States have already ratified treaties
with North Germany and Bavaria, and that we are engaged
in negotiating treaties with other powers, for the
settlement of this vexed question, and we may surely
approach this discussion without any anxiety, except
for the honor of our country.</p>

<p>Permit me to say, at the outset, that the declared
object of the present bill is all lost in certain special
features, which are nothing less than monstrous, and
utterly unworthy of a generous Republic hoping to
give an example to mankind. Surely, Sir, it is noble
to reach out and protect the rights of the citizen at
home and abroad; but no zeal in this behalf should
betray us into conduct which cannot be regarded without
a blush.</p>

<p>This bill proposes to confer upon the President prodigious
powers, such as have never been lavished before
in our history. They are without precedent. On this
account alone they should be considered carefully; and
they should not be granted, unless on good reason. If it
be shown that they are not only without precedent,
but that they are inconsistent with the requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
of modern civilization, that they are of evil example,
and that they tend directly to war,&mdash;then, on this
account, we should hesitate still more before we venture
to grant them. Not lightly can a nation set itself
against the requirements of civilization; not lightly
can a nation do an act of evil example; not lightly
can a nation take any step toward war. The whole
business is solemn. Nothing graver could challenge
the attention of the Senate.</p>

<p>Two powers are conferred upon the President: first,
to suspend commercial relations with a foreign government,
and, secondly, to arrest and detain in custody
any subject of a foreign government found within the
jurisdiction of the United States. The suspension of
commercial relations, and the arrest of innocent foreigners,
simply at the will of the President,&mdash;these
are the two powers. It would be difficult to imagine
greater.</p>

<p>We have had in our own history the instance of
an embargo, when all our merchant ships were kept
at home and forbidden to embark in foreign commerce.
That measure was intended to save our commerce from
insult and our sailors from impressment. This was
done by Act of Congress. I am not aware of any instance,
in our own history or in the history of any
other country, where there has been a suspension of
commercial relations with any foreign power, unless as
an act of war. The moment war is declared, there is,
from the fact of war, a suspension of commercial relations
with the hostile power. Commerce with that
power is impossible, and there can be no contract even
between the citizens or subjects of the two powers.
But this is war. It is now proposed to do this same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
thing and to call it peace. The proposition is new, absolutely
new. Not an instance of history, not a phrase
in the Law of Nations, sanctions it. I need not say
how little congenial it is with the age in which we live.
The present object of good men is to make war difficult,
if not impossible. Here is a way to make war
easy. To the President is given this alarming power.
In Europe war proceeds from the sovereign: in England,
from the Queen in Council; in France, from
Louis Napoleon. This is according to the genius of
monarchies. By the Constitution of our Republic it
is Congress alone that can declare war. And yet by
this bill One Man, in his discretion, may do little short
of declaring war. He may hurl one of the bolts of
war, and sever the commercial relations of two great
powers. Consider well what must ensue. Suppose the
bolt is hurled at England. All that various commerce
on which so much depends, all that interchange of
goods which contributes so infinitely to the wants of
each, all that shipping and all those steamers traversing
the ocean between the two, all the multitudinous
threads of business by which the two peoples are woven
together, warp and woof, as in a mighty loom,&mdash;all
these must be severed.</p>

<p>The next power conferred on the President is like
unto the first in its abnormal character. It is nothing
less than authority, in his discretion, to make reprisals,
by seizing innocent foreigners happening to be
in the United States. The more this is considered, the
more it must be regarded with distrust.</p>

<p>Reprisals belong to the incidents of war in the earlier
ages, before civilization had tempered the rudeness of
mankind. All reprisals are of doubtful character. Repri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>sals
on persons are barbarous. I do not say, that,
according to the received rights of war, some terrible
occasion may not arise even for this barbarous agency;
but I insist that it is frowned upon by all the best
authorities even in our own country, that it is contrary
to enlightened reason, and that it is utterly without
any recent example. Admitting that such reprisals
are not entirely discarded by writers on the Law of Nations,
they are nevertheless condemned. By the rights
of war, as once declared, the lives of prisoners taken
on the field of battle were forfeit. Early history attests
the frequency of this bloody sacrifice. Who now would
order the execution of prisoners of war? The day has
passed when any such outrage can be tolerated. But it
is hardly less barbarous to seize innocent persons whom
business or pleasure has brought within your peaceful
jurisdiction, under the guaranty of the Public Faith.</p>

<p>I am unwilling to occupy time on a matter which is
so clear in the light of modern civilization, and of that
enlightened reason which is the handmaid to civilization.
And yet the present effort will justify me in exposing
the true character of reprisals, as seen in the light
of history.</p>

<p>Reprisals were recognized by the Greeks, but disowned
by the Romans. According to Bynkershoek,
who is so much quoted on the Law of Nations, “there
is no instance of such wickedness in the history of that
magnanimous people; neither do their laws exhibit the
least trace of it.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> This is strong language, and is in
itself a condemnation of this whole agency. It is of the
more weight, as the author is our austerest authority on
questions of the Law of Nations, giving to the rights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
war the strongest statement. According to him, reprisals
are nothing less than “wickedness” (<i>improbitas</i>), and
unworthy of a magnanimous people. During the Middle
Ages, and afterwards, reprisals were in vogue; but they
never found favor. They have been constantly reprobated.
Even when formally sanctioned, they have been
practically excluded by safeguards and conditions. In
a treaty between Cromwell and the States-General there
was a stipulation against reprisals, “unless the prince
whose subject shall conceive himself to have been injured
shall first lay his complaint before the sovereign
whose subject is supposed to have committed the tortious
act, and <i>unless that sovereign shall not cause justice
to be rendered to him within three months after his application</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
This stipulation was renewed under Charles
the Second.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The same principle was declared by the
Grand Pensionary, De Witt, who, in the name of the
United Provinces, protested, “that reprisals cannot be
granted, <i>except in case of an open denial of justice</i>,” and
“that, even in case of a denial of justice, a sovereign
cannot empower his subjects to make reprisals, <i>until he
has repeatedly demanded justice for them</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> A similar
rule was also declared in the famous letter to the King
of Prussia, in the case of the Silesian loan, written by
Murray, afterward Lord Mansfield, and much praised by
Montesquieu and by Vattel.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Here it is said: “The Law
of Nations, founded upon justice, equity, convenience,
and the reason of the thing, and confirmed by long
usage, does not allow of reprisals, except in case of violent
injuries, directed or supported by the State, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
justice absolutely denied, <i>in re minime dubia</i>, by all the
tribunals, and afterwards by the prince.”<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> This is clear
and strong. I might quote authorities without end to
the same point. I content myself with adding the words
of General Halleck, who, after saying, in his admirable
manual, that “reprisals bring us to the awful confines
of actual war,” proceeds to lay down the rule,
that reprisals, even on property, can be only “where
justice has been plainly denied or most unreasonably
delayed.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> This rule commends itself as proper and
just. It is your duty to apply it on the present occasion.
But, in the face of the authorities in our own
country, judges, jurists, publicists, and commentators,
in long array, according to whom our own claim of
allegiance is coincident with that of England,&mdash;and
then, again, in face of the well-known and much-heralded
disposition of foreign powers, including England,
to settle this whole question by treaty, is it not absurd
to say that here is a case for reprisals of any
kind?</p>

<p>In the early days reprisals were directed against
persons as well as property. Even against property it
was done with hesitation, only in cases free from all
doubt, and after ample appeal to the sovereign for justice.
Against persons it was done very rarely. Grotius,
our greatest master, who brought the rules of International
Law to the touchstone of reason, asserts
that all reprisals are vindicated by custom rather than
by Nature. His language is, that this rule “is not
indeed authorized by Nature, but generally received
by custom.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Since then the tendency has been <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>to a
constant mitigation of this pretension, even as regards
property. Without burdening this discussion with cases,
which are numerous, I give a summary of Wheaton in
these words: “It appears to be the modern rule of international
usage, that property of the enemy found within
the territory of the belligerent state, or debts due to his
subjects by the Government or individuals, at the commencement
of hostilities, are not liable to be seized and
confiscated as prize of war.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> This rule, which is applicable
to the condition of things on the breaking out of
war, attests the care with which the modern Law of
Nations watches the rights of individuals, and how it
avoids making them suffer. Thus even debts are not
liable to seizure. How much more should an innocent
person be exempt from any such outrage!</p>

<p>It is when we consider the modern rule with regard
to persons, instead of property, that we are impressed
still more by its benignity. Here I quote, first a British
authority, and then an American. Mr. Phillimore, the
author of the very elaborate and candid treatise on the
Law of Nations, so full of various learning, after admitting
that reprisals, “strictly speaking, affect the persons
as well as the goods,” proceeds to say, that, “in modern
times, however, they have been chiefly confined to goods”;
and then adds, in words worthy of consideration now,
that “it is to be hoped that the reprisal of persons has
fallen, with other unnecessary and unchristian severities,
into desuetude; <i>and certainly, to seize travellers, by
way of reprisal, is a breach of the tacit faith pledged to
them by the State, when they were allowed to enter her borders</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
The same enlightened conclusion is expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
by Dana, in his excellent notes to Wheaton, as follows:
“The right of making reprisals is not limited to property,
but extends to persons; <i>still, the practice of modern
times discountenances the arrest and detention of innocent
persons strictly in the way of reprisal</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Thus do British
and American publicists concur in homage to a common
civilization.</p>

<p>If we look at the reason of the modern rule which
spares persons, we shall find it in two different considerations,
each of controlling authority: first, that an innocent
person cannot be seized in a foreign country without
a violation of the Public Faith; and, secondly, that
no private individual can be justly held responsible for
the act of his Government. On the first head Vattel
speaks as follows: “The sovereign who declares war
can no more detain the subjects of the enemy who are
found in his states at the time of the declaration than
he can their effects. <i>They have come into his dominions
on the Public Faith.</i> In permitting them to enter his
territories and continue there he tacitly promised them
full liberty and full security for their return.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> In
the same sense Halleck says, “Travellers and passing
guests are in general excepted from such liability.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
Here again Grotius speaks with the authority of a
Christian lawgiver, saying that by the Law of Nations
there can be no reprisals “on travellers or sojourners.”<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
The other reason was assigned by Mr. Webster, in his
correspondence with the British Government in relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
to the “Caroline.” The British Government having
acknowledged the act of McLeod in burning this vessel
as their act, Mr. Webster at once declared, that,
after this avowal, the individuals engaged in it could
not be held personally responsible, and he added words
worthy of memory at this juncture: “The President
presumes that it can hardly be necessary to say that
the American people, not distrustful of their ability to
redress public wrongs by public means, <i>cannot desire
the punishment of individuals, when the act complained
of is declared to have been an act of the Government
itself</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Weighty words, by which our country is forever
bound. The same principle is adopted by Halleck,
in his text-book, when he says, “No individual
is justly chargeable with the guilt of a personal crime
for the act of the community of which he is a member.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
All these authorities furnish us the same lesson,
and warn against the present proposition. Shall
we at the same time violate the Public Faith and
wreak a dishonorable vengeance on an innocent traveller
or sojourner, making him the scapegoat of his
country? Shall we do this outrage to the stranger
within our gates?</p>

<p>Another argument may be found in the extent to
which reprisal on persons has been discarded by modern
precedents. It is denounced, not only by authority,
but also by practice. I have already said that the
proposition to suspend commercial relations is without
an example in history. The other proposition is without
example since the hateful act of the first Napoleon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
condemned afterward by himself, when, at the breaking
of the short-lived Peace of Amiens, he seized innocent
Englishmen who happened to be in France, and detained
them as prisoners, precisely as is now proposed
under the present bill. Among the numerous victims
of this tyrannical decree was Lord Elgin, the father of
the late Sir Frederick Bruce, on his return from Constantinople,
where he had been ambassador. There was
also an ingenious scholar, of feeble health, but exquisite
attainments, Joseph Forsyth, author of one of the
best books ever written on Italy.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> He, too, was seized.
In the preface to his admirable work his family have
recorded the outrage. Read it, if you would know the
judgment that awaits such a transaction. There is also
another record in the pages of the English historian who
has pictured the events of that time.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This declaration of war was immediately followed by an
act as unnecessary as it was barbarous, and which contributed
more, perhaps, than any other circumstance to produce that
strong feeling of animosity against Napoleon which pervaded
all classes of the English during the remainder of the contest.
Two French vessels had been captured, under the English
letters of marque, in the Bay of Audierne, and the
First Consul made it a pretence for ordering the arrest of all
the English then travelling in France between the ages of
eighteen and sixty years. Under this savage decree, unprecedented
in the annals of modern warfare, above ten thousand
innocent individuals, who had repaired to France in pursuit
of business, science, or amusement, on the faith of the Law of
Nations, which never extended hostilities to persons in such
circumstances, were at once thrown into prison, from whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
great numbers of them were never liberated till the invasion
of the Allies in 1814.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Napoleon himself, at a later day, when reason resumed
its sway, condemned the act. In his conversations
at St. Helena with Las Cases, he said: “The greater
part of these English were wealthy or noble persons,
who were travelling for their amusement. The more
novel the act was, <i>the more flagrant its injustice</i>, the more
it answered my purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Here, then, was an admission
that the act was at once novel and unjust. The
generals that surrounded him at the time most reluctantly
enforced it. From the Memoirs of the Duchess
D’Abrantès, we learn how poignantly her gallant husband,
Junot, took it to heart and protested. He was
unwilling to have anything to do with such an infamy.
Recovering at last from the stupor caused by the order,
the brave soldier said: “My General, you know not only
my attachment to your person, but my absolute devotion
to everything which concerns you. It is that devotion
which induces me to hesitate at obeying your orders,
before imploring you to take a few hours to reflect on
the measure which you have now commanded.…
Demand my blood; demand my life; I will surrender
them without hesitation; but to ask a thing which must
cover us with&mdash;&mdash; … I am sure, that, when you
come to yourself, and are no longer fascinated by those
around you, who compel you to violent measures, you
will be of my opinion.”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Every word of this earnest expostulation
may now be justly addressed to the Senate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
You, too, Senators, should you unhappily yield to those
who now insist upon violent measures, will regret the
surrender. You will grieve that your country has been
permitted through you to fall from the great example
which it owes to mankind. Save your country; save
yourselves.</p>

<p>Suppose the law is passed, and the authority conferred
upon the President. Whom shall he seize? What innocent
foreigner? What trustful traveller? What honored
guest? It may be Mr. Dickens, or Mr. Trollope,
or Rev. Newman Hall; or it may be some merchant
here on business, guiltless of any wrong and under
the constant safeguard of the Public Faith. Permit
me to say, Sir, that, the moment you do this, you will
cover the country with shame, of which the present
bill will be the painful prelude. You will be guilty
of a barbarism kindred to that of the Abyssinian king
Theodorus. You will degrade the national name, and
make it a byword of reproach. Sir, now is the time to
arrest this dishonor. See to it by your votes that it is
impossible forever.</p>

<p>Sir, it is hard to treat this pretension with composure.
Argument, denunciation, and ridicule are insufficient. It
must be trampled under foot, so as to become a hissing
and a scorn. With all the granting of legislation, it is
solemnly proposed that good men shall suffer for acts in
which they had no part. Innocence is no excuse against
the present pretension. The whole attempt is out of
time; it is an anachronism, no better than the revival
of the <i>Prügel-knabe</i>, who was kept at the German courts
of former days to receive the stripes which the prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
had merited for his misdeeds. Surely, if anybody is to
suffer, let it be the offending Government, or those who
represent it and share its responsibilities, instead of private
persons, who in no way represent their Government,
and may condemn it. Seize the ambassador or
minister. You will then audaciously violate the Law of
Nations. The absurdity of your act will be lost in its
madness. In the seizure which is now proposed there
will be absurdity to make the world shake with laughter,
if for a moment it can cease to see the flagrant cruelty
and meanness of your conduct.</p>

<p>A debate ensued, which ran into the next day, in the course of
which Mr. Conness, of California, insisted that the striking out of the
reprisals clause would impair the efficiency of the bill, and make it
nothing but “air.” At the close of the debate, immediately before
the vote on the amendment, Mr. Sumner summed up his objection as
follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>My objection to the text of the bill which it is proposed
to strike out is, that it is a proposal of unutterable
barbarism, which, if adopted, would disgrace this
country.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The question, being taken by yeas and nays, resulted,&mdash;Yeas 30,
Nays 7; as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the sectio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>n thus amended, Mr. Williams, of Oregon, moved a substitute;
whereupon the debate was resumed, and Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p>The amendment of the Senator, and the remarks that
he has made, it seems to me, go on a mistaken hypothesis.
They accept the idea that there has been some
failure on the part of our Government with reference
to citizens abroad.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [of Massachusetts]. Is not that true?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I think it is not true; and if time
would allow now, I could go into the evidence and
show that it is not true. I have the documents here.
But we are entering upon this question to-night with
an understanding, almost a compact, that there shall
be no debate. I do not wish to break that compact.
But here are documents lying on my table containing
all the facts of record with regard to every American
citizen who has been taken into custody abroad. Examine
that record, and you will see how strenuous and
steadfast our Government has been.</p>

<p>Permit me to say that the argument of the Senator
from Oregon [<span class="smcap">Mr. Williams</span>] proceeds on a misunderstanding
of the facts. There is no occasion now for
any such legislative prompting to the Government of
the United States.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Williams.</span> I should like to ask the Senator a question.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Williams.</span> Why is it, if everything has been so
smooth and so placid upon this subject, that both of the
political parties of this country have seen proper to put in
their platforms resolutions in reference to the rights of American
citizens abroad?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I have not said that things were
placid or smooth; but I have said that our Government
has been strenuous and steadfast in the maintenance
of the rights of American citizens, whether
native-born or naturalized; and the record will show
the truth of what I say. Where has there been a
failure? Has it been in Germany? Read the correspondence,
running now over several years, between
the United States and the different powers of Germany,
and see the fidelity with which the rights of our naturalized
citizens have been maintained there.</p>

<p>I wish to be as brief as possible. If the Senator will
take the trouble to read the documents on the table, he
will see that among all the numerous applications made
by the United States to the Government of Prussia, the
leading power of Germany, there is hardly an instance
where this power did not meet us kindly and generously.
I speak according to the record. I have been
over every one of these cases; and I must say, as I read
them I felt a new gratification in the power of my country,
which made itself felt for the protection of its citizens
in those distant places, and also a new sense of the
comity of nations. A letter went forth from one of our
ministers, and though at that time this difficult question
of expatriation was still unsettled, yet, out of regard to
our country, or out of regard, it might be, sometimes, to
the personal character of our minister, the claim was
abandoned. You can hardly find an instance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness</span> rose.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Will the Senator let me finish my
sentence?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> Certainly.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> You can hardly find an instance in
that voluminous correspondence where the claim has
been persisted in on the part of the Prussian Government.
The abstract question was left unsettled; but
the individual was left free, without claim of allegiance
or military service. All this was anterior to
the treaty, by which this whole question is happily settled
forever.</p>

<p>But it is not my purpose to discuss the conduct of
foreign Governments. My simple aim is to show the
conduct of our own. That was the point with which I
began. I said that it needed no quickening such as the
Senator from Oregon proposes to apply. There is no
evidence that our Government has not been persistent
and earnest for the protection of its citizens abroad,
whether native-born or naturalized, and I alluded to
Prussia only by way of illustration. Pass that by. We
have then the greater and more complex case of England.
But I would rather not enter upon this. Here
are the documents on my table, the passages all marked,
which would illustrate the conduct of the British Government
and the British tribunals toward every one of
these persons whose names have been brought in question.
I do not wish to go into this question. I should
be misunderstood; and it is not necessary. I am speaking
now of the conduct of our own Government, rather
than of the conduct of any other Government. Mark,
Sir, my reply to the Senator from Oregon was, that
our Government did not need any additional power
or any additional impulse to activity in this behalf.
Already it has the power to do everything permitted
by the Law of Nations, and it ought not to do anything
else.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Conness followed in support of the bill, and to a correction from
Mr. Sumner retorted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The honorable Senator would be very quick to demand
the interference of all the powers of this Government in behalf
of an arrested American citizen, if he were black. But,
Sir, those arrested happen to be of another color,&mdash;not
a color which appeals to his sympathies, but a color that
allows him to belittle their arrest and incarceration,&mdash;that
enables him to say here in the Senate that our Government
have done everything that they could do, all that was necessary.
It is true in his judgment, I have no doubt; for,
if you only write letters, if you only publish and utter productions
of the brain, if you only present views, the honorable
Senator is satisfied. Those are his means, except when
the progress through the thoroughfares of the city or the
country of an American citizen of African descent is involved.
Then views are at once thrown to the dogs, and he demands
the interference of the Government, the police authority; if
it be a railroad company, repeal their acts of incorporation!
No matter how much capital stands in the way,&mdash;it may be
$10,000,000 that is affected,&mdash;repeal their acts at once!
How dare they impiously set up their tyranny over one human
being who is stamped with American citizenship?…
The law as proposed to be passed under the direction of the
honorable Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations
amounts to nothing.… I hope, without detaining the Senate
any longer, that we shall not add to our too great delay
upon these questions the offence and insult that the passage
of this Act would be as proposed by the Committee.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To this attack Mr. Sumner replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I hesitate very much to say another word; and yet I
think the Senate will pardon me, if I make a brief reply
to the charge, so absolutely unjust, of the Senator from
California. He throws upon me the reproach of indifferen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>ce
to foreigners. Sir, I deny the imputation, and
challenge comparison on this head with any Senator on
this floor. Here I know that I am without blame. Sir,
you do not forget that more than ten years ago there
was a storm that passed over this country which had a
name more familiar than polite: I mean Know-nothing-ism.
It was everywhere, and enveloped my own State.
At that time I had the honor of holding the position
which I now hold. Did I yield to this storm, when it
was carrying all before it? Sir, at that time I went
down to Faneuil Hall, and in the presence of one of the
largest audiences ever there assembled, and knowing well
the prevailing sentiment, I made a speech vindicating
the rights of emigrants to our country and promising
them welcome. I have that speech here now, and I will
read a few sentences from it. This was on the 2d of
November, 1855,&mdash;nearly thirteen years ago. Pardon
me for reading this record of other days; but I am justified
by the attacks to which I have been exposed. If
any foreign-born citizen is disposed to hearken to the
Senator from California impeaching me, I ask him to
bear in mind how I stood for his rights at another time,
when there were fewer ready to stand for them than
now. I read from this forgotten speech, as reported at
that time.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner read the first two paragraphs on the thirteenth page of
the pamphlet edition.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was my argument for the rights of the foreign-born
among us. To all of them I offered such welcome
as I could:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There are our broad lands, stretching towards the setting
sun; let them come and take them. Ourselves children
of the Pilgrims of a former generation, let us not turn from
the Pilgrims of the present. Let the home founded by our
emigrant fathers continue open in its many mansions to the
emigrants of to-day.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir, those were the words which I uttered in Faneuil
Hall at a time when the opposition to foreigners was
scouring over the whole country. Others yielded to
that tempest, but I did not yield. All my votes in this
Chamber, from the first day that I entered it down to
this moment, have been in the same direction, and for
that welcome which I thus early announced. Never
have I missed an occasion to vote for their protection;
never shall I miss any such occasion. I was the first
in the Senate to announce the essential incompatibility
between the claim of perpetual allegiance and the license
of unlimited emigration which we had witnessed, saying
that every Irishman or German leaving with the
consent of his Government was a living witness to the
hollowness of the original pretension. And now I am
most anxious to see expatriation a law as well as a fact.
If I do not adopt the expedients proposed, it is because
I regard them as less calculated to produce the much-desired
result than other means equally at hand, to the
end that the rights of our naturalized citizens may find
adequate safeguard everywhere. The present bill can
do little good, and may do harm. It will not protect a
single citizen; but it may be a drag on those pending
negotiations by which the rights of all will be secured.
Too studious of the Law of Nations, perhaps, to be willing
to treat it with distrust or neglect, I look to that
prevailing agency rather than to the more limited instrumentality
of Municipal Law. It is the province of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Municipal Law to determine rights at home,&mdash;how a
foreign-born person may be naturalized in our country,&mdash;how
he may be admitted to all the transcendent
privileges of American citizenship; but it belongs to
another system of law to determine what shall be his
privileges, should he return to the country which gave
him birth. We may, by our declarations, by our diplomacy,
by our power, do much; but it is by our treaties
that we shall fix all these rights in adamant. The
Senator seems to have no higher idea than to write
them in the fleeting passions of party. My vote will
never be wanting to elevate them above all such fitful
condition, and to place them under the perpetual sanction
of International Law,&mdash;the only law which can
bind two different powers. Sir, the Senator from California
shall not go before me; he shall not be more
swift than I; he shall not take one single step in advance
of me. Be the person Irish or German or African
or Chinese, he shall have from me the same equal
protection. Can the Senator say as much?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The year 1868 was memorable for the Chinese Embassy, with Hon.
Anson Burlingame at its head, which, arriving first at Washington by
the way of San Francisco, negotiated a treaty with the United States,
and then visited Europe. The abundant hospitality with which it was
received throughout the United States was marked at Boston by a distinguished
reception and entertainment on the part of the municipal
authorities. August 20th, the Embassy was received by Hon. Nathaniel
B. Shurtleff, Mayor, and escorted in public procession through
the principal streets, and with the customary diplomatic salutes, to the
Parker House, where they were lodged as the guests of the city. The
next day at noon they were publicly received at Faneuil Hall, which
was decorated for the occasion. In the evening they were entertained
at a banquet at the St. James Hotel, where were present about two
hundred and twenty-five gentlemen, including the City Government.</p>

<p>The company is thus described in the official report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hon. Nathaniel B. Shurtleff, Mayor, presided. On his right were seated
Hon. Anson Burlingame, Chief of the Embassy; His Excellency Alexander
H. Bullock, Governor of the Commonwealth; Teh Lao-yeh, English Interpreter
attached to the Embassy; Hon. Charles Sumner, Chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate; Hon.
Caleb Cushing; Major-General Irwin McDowell, U. S. A.; Commodore
John Rodgers, U. S. N.; Charles G. Nazro, Esq., President of the Board
of Trade. On the left of the Mayor were seated Chih Ta-jin, Associate
Minister; Mr. McLeavy Brown, Secretary to the Embassy; Sun Ta-jin,
Associate Minister; M. Émile Dechamps, Secretary to the Embassy; Fung
Lao-yeh, English Interpreter; Ralph Waldo Emerson, LL.D.; Rev. George

of Harvard College; Hon. George S. Hillard, United States District<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> Attorney;

Board of Foreign Missions; and many of the leading merchants and professional
men of Boston.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the banquet speeches were made by the Mayor, Mr. Burlingame,
Governor Bullock, Mr. Sumner, Mr. Cushing, Mr. Emerson, General
Banks, Mr. Nazro, and Mr. Whipple.</p>

<p>The Mayor announced as the fifth regular toast, “The Supplementary
Treaty with China,” and called upon Mr. Sumner to respond. Mr.
Burlingame had already said in his speech, while declining any elaborate
exposition of the Treaty: “No, Sir,&mdash;I leave the exposition of
that treaty to the distinguished Senator on my right, who was its champion
in the Senate, and who procured for it a unanimous vote.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. MAYOR,&mdash;I cannot speak on this interesting
occasion without first declaring the happiness I
enjoy at meeting my friend of many years in the exalted
position he now holds. Besides this personal relation,
he was also an honored associate in representing
the good people of this community, and in advancing a
great cause, which he championed with memorable eloquence
and fidelity. Such are no common ties.</p>

<p>The splendid welcome now offered by the municipal
authorities of Boston is only a natural expression of
prevailing sentiments. Here his labors and triumphs
began. In your early applause and approving voices
he first tasted of that honor which is now his in such
ample measure. He is one of us, who, going forth into
a strange country, has come back with its highest trus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>ts
and dignities. Once the representative of a single Congressional
district, he now represents the most populous
nation of the globe. Once the representative of little
more than a third part of Boston, he is now the representative
of more than a third part of the human race.
The population of the globe is estimated at twelve hundred
millions; that of China at more than four hundred
and sometimes even at five hundred millions.</p>

<p>If in this position there be much to excite wonder,
there is still more for gratitude in the unparalleled opportunity
it affords. What we all ask is opportunity.
Here is opportunity on a surpassing scale,&mdash;employed,
I am sure, to advance the best interests of the human
family; and if these are advanced, no nation can suffer.
Each is contained in all. With justice and generosity
as the reciprocal rule,&mdash;and nothing else can be the aim
of this great Embassy,&mdash;there can be no limits to the
immeasurable consequences. Nor can I hesitate to say
that concessions and privileges are of less consequence
than that spirit of friendship and good neighborhood,
embracing alike the distant and the near, which, once
established, renders all else easy.</p>

<p>The necessary result of the present experiment in
diplomacy will be to make the countries it visits better
known to the Chinese, and also to make the Chinese
better known to them. Each will know the other better,
and better comprehend that condition of mutual dependence
which is the law of humanity. In relations
among nations, as in common life, this is of infinite
value. Thus far, I fear the Chinese are poorly informed
with regard to us. I am sure we are poorly informed
with regard to them. We know them through the
porcelain on our tables, with its lawless perspecti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>ve,
and the tea-chest, with its unintelligible hieroglyphics.
There are two pictures of them in the literature of
our language, which cannot fail to leave an impression.
The first is in “Paradise Lost,” where Milton, always
learned, even in his poetry, represents Satan descending
in his flight</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">“on the barren plains</div>
<div class="verse">Of Sericana, where <i>Chineses</i> drive</div>
<div class="verse">With sails and wind their cany wagons light.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The other is in that admirable “Discourse on the Study
of the Law of Nature and Nations,” where Sir James
Mackintosh, in words of singular felicity, points to “the
tame, but ancient and immovable civilization of China.”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
It is for us at last to enlarge these pictures, and to fill
the canvas with life.</p>

<p>I do not know if it has occurred to our honored guest
that he is not the first stranger who, after sojourning in
this distant, unknown land, has come back loaded with
its honors, and with messages to the Christian powers.
He is not without a predecessor in his mission. There
is another career as marvellous as his own. I refer to
the Venetian Marco Polo, whose reports, once discredited
as the fables of a traveller, are now recognized
among the sources of history, and especially of geographical
knowledge. Nobody can read them without
feeling their verity. It was in the latter part of the far-away
thirteenth century that this enterprising Venetian,
with his father and uncle, all merchants, journeyed from
Venice, by the way of Constantinople, Trebizond on the
Black Sea, and Central Asia, until they reached first the
land of Prester John, and then that golden country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
known as Cathay, where the lofty ruler, Kublaï Khan,
treated them with gracious consideration, and employed
young Polo as his ambassador. This was none other
than China, and the lofty ruler, called the Grand Khan,
was none other than the first of its Mongolian dynasty,
having his imperial residence in the immense city of
Kambalu, or Peking. After many years of illustrious
service, the Venetian, with his companions, was dismissed
with splendor and riches, charged with letters
for European sovereigns, as our Bostonian is charged
with similar letters now. There were letters for the
Pope, the King of France, the King of Spain, and other
Christian princes. It does not appear that England
was expressly designated. Her name, so great now, was
not at that time on the visiting list of the distant Emperor.
Such are the contrasts in national life. Marco
Polo reached Venice, on his return, in 1295, at the very
time when Dante, in Florence, was meditating his divine
poem, and Roger Bacon, in England, was astonishing
the age with his knowledge. These were his two
greatest contemporaries, constituting with himself the
triumvirate of the century.</p>

<p>The return of the Venetian to his native city was
attended by incidents which have not occurred among
us. Bronzed by long residence under the sun of the
East, wearing the dress of a Tartar, and speaking his
native language with difficulty, it was some time before
his friends could be persuaded of his identity. Happily
there is no question on the identity of our returned fellow-citizen;
and surely it cannot be said that he speaks
his native language with difficulty. A dinner was
spread at Venice as here at Boston, and now, after the
lapse of nearly six hundred years, the Venetian d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>inner
still lives in glowing description. Marco Polo, with
his companions, appeared first in long robes of crimson
satin reaching to the floor, which, when the guests had
washed their hands, were changed for other robes of
crimson damask, and then again, after the first course,
for other robes of crimson velvet, and at the conclusion
of the banquet, for the ordinary dress worn by the rest
of the company. Meanwhile the other costly garments
were distributed among the attendants at the table. In
all your magnificence to-night, Mr. Mayor, I have seen
no such largess. Then were brought forward the coarse
threadbare garments in which they had travelled, when,
on ripping the lining and patches with a knife, costly
jewels, in sparkling showers, leaped forth before the
eyes of the company, who for a time were motionless
with wonder. Then at last, says the Italian chronicler,
every doubt was banished, and all were satisfied that
these were the valiant and honorable gentlemen of the
house of Polo. I do not relate this history to suggest
any such operation on the dress of our returned fellow-citizen.
No such evidence is needed to assure us of his
identity.</p>

<p>The success of Marco Polo is amply attested. From
his habit of speaking of “millions” of people and “millions”
of money, he was known as <i>Messer Millioni</i>, or
the millionaire, being the earliest instance in history of
a designation so common in our prosperous age. But
better than “millions” was the knowledge he imparted,
and the impulse he gave to that science which teaches
the configuration of the globe and the place of nations
on its face. His travels, dictated by him, were reproduced
in various languages, and, after the invention of
printing, the book was multiplied in more than fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
editions. Unquestionably it prepared the way for the
two greatest geographical discoveries of modern times,&mdash;the
Cape of Good Hope, by Vasco da Gama, and the
New World, by Christopher Columbus. One of his admirers,
a French <i>savant</i>, does not hesitate to say, that,
“when, in the long series of ages, we seek the three
men who, by the magnitude and influence of their discoveries,
have most contributed to the progress of geography
or the knowledge of the globe, the modest name
of the Venetian traveller finds a place in the same line
with those of Alexander the Great and Christopher Columbus.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
It is well known that the imagination of
the Genoese navigator was fired by the revelations of
the Venetian, and that, in his mind, the countries embraced
by his transcendent discovery were none other
than the famed Cathay, with its various dependencies.
In his report to the Spanish sovereigns, Cuba was nothing
else than Zipangu, or Japan, as described by the
Venetian, and he thought himself near a Grand Khan,&mdash;meaning,
as he says, a king of kings. Columbus was
mistaken. He had not reached Cathay or the Grand
Khan; but he had discovered a new world, destined in
the history of civilization to be more than Cathay, and,
in the lapse of time, to welcome the Ambassador of the
Grand Khan.</p>

<p>The Venetian, returning home, journeyed out of the
East, westward; our Marco Polo, returning home, journeyed
out of the West, eastward. And yet they both
came from the same region: their common starting-point
was Peking. This change is typical of the surpassing
revolution under whose influence the Orient will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
become the Occident. Journeying westward, the first
welcome is from the nations of Europe; journeying
eastward, the first welcome is from our Republic. It
remains that this welcome should be extended, until,
opening a pathway for the mightiest commerce of the
world, it embraces within the sphere of American activity
that ancient ancestral empire, where population, industry,
and education, on an unprecedented scale, create
resources and necessities on an unprecedented scale also.
See to it, merchants of the United States, and you, merchants
of Boston, that this opportunity is not lost.</p>

<p>And this brings me, Mr. Mayor, to the Treaty, which
you invited me to discuss. But I will not now enter
upon this topic. If you did not call me to order for
speaking too long, I fear I should be called to order in
another place for undertaking to speak of a treaty not
yet proclaimed by the President. One remark I will
make, and take the consequences. The Treaty does not
propose much; but it is an excellent beginning, and, I
trust, through the good offices of our fellow-citizen, the
honored plenipotentiary, will unlock those great Chinese
gates which have been bolted and barred for long centuries.
The Embassy is more than the Treaty, because it
prepares the way for further intercourse, and helps that
new order of things which is among the promises of the
Future.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Burlingame’s sudden death, at St. Petersburg, February 23, 1870,
arrested the remarkable career he had begun, leaving uncertain what
he might have accomplished for China with European powers, and also
uncertain the possible influence he might have exercised with the great
nation he represented, in opening its avenues of approach, and bringing
it within the sphere of Western civilization.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech at the Flag-Raising of the Grant and Colfax Club, in
Ward Six, Boston, on the Evening of September 14, 1868.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I find a special motive for being here to-night in
the circumstance that this is the ward where I was
born and have always voted, and where I expect to vote
at the coming election. Here I voted twice for Abraham
Lincoln, and here I expect to vote for Grant and
Colfax. According to familiar phrase, this is my ward.
This, also, is my Congressional District. Though representing
the Commonwealth in the Senate, I am not
without a representative in the other House. Your Congressional
representative is my representative. Therefore
I confess a peculiar interest in this ward and this
district.</p>

<p>In hanging out the national flag at the beginning of
the campaign, you follow the usage of other times; but
to my mind it is peculiarly appropriate at the present
election. The national flag is the emblem of loyalty,
and the very question on which you are to vote in the
present election is whether loyalty or rebellion shall
prevail. It is whether the national flag shall wave
gloriously over a united people in the peaceful enjoyment
of Equal Rights for All, or whether it shall be dishonored
by traitors. This is the question. Under all
forms of statement or all resolutions, it comes back to
this. As during the war all of you voted for the national
flag, while some carried it forward in the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
peril, so now all of you must vote for it, and be ready
to carry it forward again, if need be, in the face of
peril.</p>

<p>As loyalty is the distinctive characteristic of our
party, so is disloyalty the distinctive characteristic of
the opposition. I would not use too strong language,
or go beyond the strictest warrant of facts; but I am
obliged to say that we cannot recognize the opposition
at this time as anything else but the Rebel Party in
disguise, or the Rebel Party under the <i>alias</i> of Democracy.
The Rebels have taken the name of Democrats,
and with this historic name hope to deceive people
into their support. But, whatever name they adopt,
they are the same Rebels who, after defeat on many
bloody fields, at last surrendered to General Grant, and,
by the blessing of God and the exertions of the good
people, will surrender to him again.</p>

<p>I am unwilling to call such a party democratic. It is
not so in any sense. It is not so according to the natural
meaning of the term, for a Democrat is a friend of
popular rights; nor is it so according to the examples of
our history, for all these disown the policy of the opposition.
Thomas Jefferson was an original Democrat;
but he drew with his own hand the Declaration of Independence,
which announces that all men are equal in
rights, and that just government stands only on the consent
of the governed. Andrew Jackson was another Democrat;
but he put down South Carolina treason with a
strong hand, and gave the famous toast, “The Union, it
must be preserved.” These were Democrats, representative
Democrats, boldly announcing the Equal Rights
of All and the Unity of the Nation. Thus looking at
the word, in its natural bearing or in the gr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>eat examples
of our history, we find it entirely inapplicable to a party
which denies equal rights and palters with Rebellion itself.
Such a party is the Rebel Party, and nothing else;
and this is the name by which it should be known.</p>

<p>Look at the history of their leaders,&mdash;Rebels all,
Rebels all. I mention those only who take an active
part. A party, like a man, is known by the company it
keeps. What a company! Here is Forrest, with the
blood of Fort Pillow still dripping from his hands;
Semmes, fresh from the Alabama, glorying in his piracies
on our commerce; Wade Hampton, the South
Carolina slave-master and cavalry officer of the Rebellion;
Beauregard, the Rebel general, who telegraphed for
the execution of Abolition prisoners; Stephens, Toombs,
and Cobb, a Georgia triumvirate of Rebels; and at the
head of this troop is none other than Horatio Seymour
of New York, who, without actually enlisting in the Rebellion,
dallied with it, and addressed its fiendish representatives
in New York as “friends.” A party with
such leaders and such a chief is the Rebel Party.</p>

<p>Such a party, so filled and permeated with treason,
cannot utter any shibboleth of loyalty. Every loyal word
must stick in its throat, as “Amen” stuck in the throat
of Macbeth, after the murder of his royal guest. Therefore,
I say again, let it be called the Rebel Party. This
is a truthful designation, stamping upon the party its
real character. By this name I now summon it to judgment.
If I could make my voice heard over the Republic,
it should carry everywhere this just summons. It
should go forth from this schoolhouse, traversing the
land, echoing from valley to valley, from village to village,
from town to town, and warning all who love their
country against a party which is nothing but a continuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of the Rebellion. How can such a party pretend
to hang out the national flag? I do not wonder that
its Presidential candidate has cried out in his distress,
“Press the financial question!” Yes, press anything
to make the country forget the disloyalty of the party,&mdash;anything
to divert attention from the national flag,
which they would dishonor. But on the financial question,
as everywhere else, they are disloyal. Repudiation
is disloyalty, early taught by Jefferson Davis in his own
State, and now adopted by the Rebel Party, North and
South.</p>

<p>Here I come back to the point with which I began.
Hang out the national flag! It is the flag of our country,
our whole country, beaming with all its inseparable
stars, and proclaiming in all its folds the strength, the
glory, and the beauty of Union. Let that flag be the
light to your footsteps. <i>By this conquer!</i> And surely
you will conquer. The people are not ready to join
with Rebels or submit to Rebel yoke. They will stand
by the flag at the ballot-box, as they stood by it on
the bloody field. History has recorded the triumphant
election of Abraham Lincoln, as the representative
of Loyalty against Rebellion. Thank God, it will soon
make the same joyful record with regard to Grant and
Colfax, the present representatives of Loyalty against
Rebellion.</p>

<p>Every man must do his duty, each in his way, according
to his ability,&mdash;some by voice, and others by efforts
of a different kind, but all must work and vote. The
cause is that of our country and its transcendent future,
pictured in the flag. And permit me to remind you
that our Congressional District has obligations it cannot
forget. It must be true to itself and to its own <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>example.
At the last Presidential election there was a report,
which travelled all the way to Washington, that ours
was a doubtful district. On the evening of the election,
as soon as the result was known, I had the happiness
of telegraphing to the President that in this district the
majority was some five thousand for himself and Mr.
Hooper. It so happened that it was the first despatch
received from any quarter announcing the triumph of
that great day. On reading it, the President remarked,
with his humorous point: “Five thousand majority!
If this is a specimen of the doubtful districts, what
may we expect of the whole country?” This victory
must be repeated. There must be another five thousand
majority; and let General Grant, like Abraham Lincoln,
measure from our majority the majorities throughout
the country, giving assurance that the Rebel Party is
defeated and utterly routed in its last desperate struggle.
This is Beacon Hill, the highest point of Boston, where
in early days were lighted the beacon fires which flashed
over the country. The fires which we light on Beacon
Hill will be of congratulation and joy.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter to a Citizen of St. Louis, October 3, 1868.</span></p>

<p>The following letter appeared in the <i>St. Louis Democrat</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, October 3, 1868.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am pained to learn that there can
be any question among good Republicans with
regard to the enfranchisement of the colored race, especially
as declared in the Constitutional Amendment now
pending in Missouri. When shall this great question
be settled, if not now? Why wait? Why prolong the
agony? There is only one way in which it can be settled.
Why not at once? All who vote against it only
vote to continue the agitation, which will never end except
with the establishment of the Equal Rights of All.</p>

<p>Only in this way can the Declaration of Independence
be vindicated in its self-evident truths. As long
as men are excluded from the suffrage on account of
color, it is gross impudence for any nation to say that
they are equal in rights. Of course, men are not equal
in strength, size, or other endowments, physical or mental;
but they are equal in rights, which is what our fathers
declared. They are equal before God, equal before
the divine law; they should be made equal before
human law. Equality before the Law is the true rule.</p>

<p>How can any possible evil result from a rule which is
so natural and just? There can be no conflict of races
where there is no denial of rights. It is only when
rights are denied that conflict begins. See to it that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> all
are treated with justice, and there will be that peace
which is the aspiration of good men. For the sake of
peace I pray that this great opportunity be not lost.</p>

<p>I hear a strange cry about the supremacy of one race
over another. Of course I am against this with my
whole heart and soul. I was against it when it showed
itself in the terrible pretensions of the slave-master;
and now I am against it, as it shows itself in the most
shameful oligarchy of which history has made mention,&mdash;an
oligarchy of the skin. Reason, humanity, religion,
and common sense, all reject the wretched thing. Even
if the whites are afraid that the blacks will become an
oligarchy and rule their former masters, this is no reason
for a continued denial of rights. But this inquietude on
account of what is nicknamed “negro supremacy” is as
amusing as it is incredible. It is one of the curiosities
of history. Occupied as I am at this moment, I should
be tempted to put aside all other things and journey to
the Mississippi in order to look at a company of whites
who will openly avow their fear of “negro supremacy.”
I should like to see their pallid faces, and hear the confession
from their own trembling lips. Such a company
of whites would be a sight to behold. Falstaff’s sorry
troops were nothing to them.</p>

<p>Such foolish fears and foolish arguments cannot prevail
against the great cause of Equal Rights. Spite of
all obstacles and all prejudices, this truth must triumph.
Was it not declared by our fathers? What they declared
is a promise perpetually binding on us, their children.</p>

<p>Accept my best wishes, and believe me, dear Sir, faithfully
yours,</p>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;If I have taken little part
in the present canvass, you will do me the justice
to believe that it is from no failure of interest in the
cause for which I have so often pleaded; nor is it from
any lukewarmness to the candidates. The cause is
nothing less than our country redeemed from peril and
dedicated to Human Rights, so as to become an example
to mankind. The candidates are illustrious citizens,
always loyal to this great cause, both of surpassing
merit, and one of unequalled renown in the suppression
of the Rebellion. In this simple statement I open the
whole case. The cause would commend any candidates,
and I might almost add that the candidates would commend
any cause.</p>

<p>It is only in deference to my good physician that I
have thus far forborne those customary efforts to which

acclaim which is filling the land.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Indulge me still further while for a moment I allude

Meeting my fellow-citizens now, it would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
out of order, I believe, nor should I depart from any of
the proprieties of my position, if I proceeded to give you
an account of my stewardship during the term of service
about to expire. But when I consider that this extends
over six busy years, beginning while the Rebellion
still raged and continuing through all the anxious
period of Reconstruction,&mdash;that it embraces nothing
less than the Abolition of Slavery, and all the steps by
which this transcendent measure was promoted and consummated,
also the various efforts for the establishment
of Equal Rights, especially in the court-room and at the
ballot-box, thus helping the fulfilment of the promises
originally made in the Declaration of Independence,&mdash;that
it embraces, besides, all the infinite questions of
taxation, finance, railroads, business and foreign relations,
including many important treaties, among which
was that for the acquisition of the Russian possessions
in North America,&mdash;and considering, further, how these
transactions belong to the history of our country, where
they are already read, I content myself with remarking
that in all of them I have borne a part, I trust not unworthy
of the honored Commonwealth whose representative
I am; and here I invite your scrutiny and candid
judgment.</p>

<p>Possibly some of the frequent criticism to which I
have been exposed is already dulled by time or answered
by events. A venerable statesman, eminent in
the profession, once rebuked me for the term <i>Equality
before the Law</i>, which I had taken from the French, as
expressing more precisely than the Declaration of Independence
that equality in rights which is all that constitutions
or laws can secure. My learned critic had
never met this term in the Common Law, or in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
English language, and therefore he did not like the
innovation. In the same spirit other efforts have been
encountered, often with virulence, especially those two
fundamentals of Reconstruction,&mdash;first, the power of
Congress over the Rebel States, whether as territories,
or provinces, or as States having no republican government,
or, according to the language of President Lincoln,
“out of their proper practical relation with the
Union,”<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and, secondly, the necessity of lifting the freedman
into Equal Rights, civil and political, so as to make
him a part of the body politic. Who can forget the
clamor at these two propositions? All this has happily
ceased, except as an echo from Rebels and their allies,
whose leading part is a protest against the power of
Congress and the equal rights of the freedman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though formal criticism has tardily died out, there is
sometimes a warning against men of “one idea,” with a
finger-point at myself. Here I meet my accuser face
to face. What duty have I failed to perform? Let it
be specified. What interest have I neglected? Has it
been finance? The “Globe” will show my earnest and
elaborate effort at the beginning of the war, warning
against an inconvertible currency, and a similar effort
made recently to secure the return to specie payments.
Has it been taxation, or commerce, or railroads, or business
in any of its forms, or foreign relations, with which,
as Chairman of the Senate Committee on this subject,
I have been particularly connected? On all of these I
refer to the record. What, then, have I neglected? It
is true, that, while bearing these things in mind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
neglecting none, I felt it a supreme duty to warn my
country against the perils from Slavery, and to insist
upon irreversible guaranties for the security of all, especially
those freedmen whom we could not consent to
sacrifice without the most shameful ingratitude. As the
urgency was great, I also was urgent. In season and out
of season, at all times, in all places, here at home and
in the Senate, I insisted upon the abolition of Slavery,
and the completion of this great work by the removal
of its whole brood of inequalities, so that it should not
reappear in another form. But my earnestness and constancy
only imperfectly represented the cause. There
could be no excess,&mdash;nothing too strong. The Republic
was menaced; where was the limit to patriotic duty?
Human Rights were in jeopardy; who that had a heart
to feel could be indifferent? Nobody could do too
much. This was not possible. No wisdom too great,
no voice too eloquent, no courage too persevering. Of
course, I claim no merit for effort in this behalf; but I
appeal to you, my fellow-citizens, that the time for reproach
on this account is past. We must be “practical,”
says the critic. Very well. Here we agree. But, pray,
who has been “practical”? Is it those laggards, who,
after clinging to Slavery, then denied the power of Congress,
and next scouted the equal rights of the freedman?
Permit me to say that the “practical” statesman
foresees the future and provides for it.</p>

<p>Whoever does anything with his whole heart makes
it for the time his “one idea.” Every discoverer, every
inventor, every poet, every artist, every orator, every
general, every statesman, is absorbed in his work; and
he succeeds just in proportion as for the time it becomes
his “one idea.” The occasion must not be unworthy or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
petty; but the more complete the self-dedication, the
more effective is the result. I know no better instance
of “one idea” pursued to a triumphant end than when
our candidate, after planning his campaign, announced
that he meant “to fight it out on this line, if it took all
summer.” Here was no occasion for reproach, except
from Rebels, who would have been glad to see him fail
in that singleness of idea which gave him the victory.
There are other places where the same singleness is
needed and the idea is not less lofty. The Senate Chamber
has its battles also; and the conflict embraces the
whole country. Personally, I have nothing to regret,
except my own inadequacy. I would have done more,
if I could. Call it “one idea.” That idea is nothing
less than country, with all that is contained in that inspiring
word, and with the infinite vista of the same
blessings for all mankind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From these allusions, suggested by my own personal
relations, I come directly to the issues of this canvass.
Others have presented them so fully that there is less
need of any minute exposition on my part, even if the
heralds of triumph did not announce the certain result.
But you will bear with me while I state briefly what
is to be decided. This may be seen in general or in
detail.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, you are to decide on the means
for the final suppression of the Rebellion, and the establishment
of security for the future. Shall the Rebellion
which you have subdued on the bloody field be permitted
to assert its power again, or shall it be trampled
out, so that its infamous pretensions shall disappear forever?
These general questions involve the whole issue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
If you sympathize with the Rebellion, or decline to take
security against its recurrence, then vote for Seymour
and Blair. I need not add, that, if you are in earnest
against the Rebellion, and seek just safeguards for the
Republic, then vote for Grant and Colfax. The case is
too plain for argument.</p>

<p>It may be put more precisely still: <i>Shall the men who
saved the Republic continue to rule it, or shall it be handed
over to Rebels and their allies?</i> Such is the simple issue,
stripped of all hypocritical guise; for here, as in other
days, the real question is concealed by the enemy. The
plausible terms of Law and Constitution, with even the
pretence of generosity, now employed to rehabilitate the
Rebellion, are unmasked by the witty touch of “Hudibras,”
whose words are as pointed now as under Charles
the Second:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“What’s liberty of conscience,</div>
<div class="verse">I’ th’ natural and genuine sense?</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis to restore, with more security,</div>
<div class="verse">Rebellion to its ancient purity.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the one side are loyal multitudes, and the generous
freedmen who bared themselves to danger as our
allies, with Grant still at their head; and on the other
are Rebels, under the name of the Democratic Party, all
dripping with blood from innumerable fields of slaughter
where loyal men gasped away life,&mdash;from Fort Pillow,
from Andersonville, from pirate decks,&mdash;hurrying, with
Seymour at their head, to govern the Republic in the
name of the Lost Cause. Not so fast, ye men of blood!
Stand back! They who encountered you before will
encounter you again.</p>

<p>I would not make thi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>s statement too strong. I wish
to keep within bounds. But the facts are too patent to
admit of doubt. Yes, it is the old Democracy, which,
after giving to the Rebellion its denationalizing pretension
of State Rights, and all its wicked leaders, from
Davis to Forrest and Semmes,&mdash;after thwarting every
measure for its suppression as “unconstitutional,” from
the Proclamation of Emancipation to the firing of a gun
or the condemnation of Vallandigham,&mdash;after interfering
with enlistments also as “unconstitutional,”&mdash;after
provoking sympathetic riots,&mdash;after holding up “blue
lights” for the guidance of the enemy,&mdash;after hanging
upon the country like a paralysis,&mdash;and after, finally,
under the lead of Seymour, declaring the war a “failure,”&mdash;this
same Democracy, still under the lead of Seymour,
champions the Lost Cause. Under the pretence
of restoring Rebels to rights, it seeks to restore them to
power; and this is the very question on which you are
to vote. The Tories at the end of the Revolution were
more moderate. They did not insist upon instant restoration
to rights forfeited by treason; nor did they
bring forward a candidate against Washington. This
is reserved for the Tories of our day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All this is general. Descending to details, we find
that the issue now presented reappears in other questions.
Of these none is more important than that of the
Reconstruction Acts, which have been openly assailed as
“unconstitutional, revolutionary, and void.”<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> In nothing
more than in this declaration, associated with the
letter of its candidate, do we behold the audacity of the
Rebel Party. Even while professing allegiance and asking
your vote, they proclaim war in a new form. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
of <i>Secession</i> maintained by arms, it is now <i>Nullification</i>
maintained by arms. In no other way can we interpret
the party platform, and the programme of Mr. Blair,
when, with customary frankness, he calls upon the President
“to declare these Acts null and void, compel the
army to undo its usurpations at the South, and disperse
the carpet-bag State governments.”<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Here is Nullification
with a vengeance,&mdash;that very Nullification which,
in a much milder type, made Andrew Jackson threaten
to hang its authors high as Haman. Secession is declared
to be settled by the war; but Nullification is
openly recognized. What is the difference between the
two? The answer is plain. Secession is war out of the
Union; Nullification is war in the Union. And this is
the open menace of the Rebel Party.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Reconstruction Acts err from what they fail to
do rather than from what they do. They do too little
rather than too much. They should have secured a
piece of land to the landless freedman, whose unrewarded
toil has mingled for generations in the soil;
and they should have secured a system of common
schools open to all. In these demands, as in every
other measure of Reconstruction, I would do nothing
in severity or triumph, nothing to punish or humble.
Nor is it only in justice to the freedman, who has a bill
against his former master for unpaid wages, and also
against the country for an infinite debt, but it is for
the good of all constituting the community, including
the former master. Nothing can be truer than that
under such influences society will be improved, chara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>cter
will be elevated, and the general resources will
be enlarged. Only in this way will the Barbarism of
Slavery be banished, and a true civilization organized
in its place. Our simple object is expressed in the
words of Holy Writ: “Let us build these cities, and
make about them walls and towers, gates and bars,
while the land is yet before us.”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> By contributing to
this work, by laboring for its accomplishment, by sending
it our God-speed, we perform a service at once of
the highest charity and the highest patriotism, which
hereafter the children of the South, emancipated from
error, will rejoice to recognize. With Human Rights
under a permanent safeguard, there can be no limit to
prosperity. As under this sunshine the land yields its
increase and the gardens bloom with beauty, while commerce
and manufactures enjoy a new life, they will confess
that we did well for them, and will hail with pride
the increased glory of the Republic. If, as in ancient
Rome, we demanded the heads of senators and orators,&mdash;if,
as in England, we took the life and estate of all
traitors,&mdash;if, as in Germany, we fatigued the sword
with slaughter, and cried “havoc,”&mdash;if, as in France,
we set up guillotines, and worked them until the blood
stood in puddles beneath,&mdash;if, as in all these historic
countries, we acted in pitiless vengeance,&mdash;if in anything
we have done or attempted there was one deed
of vengeance,&mdash;then we, too, might deserve a chastening
censure. But all that we have done, next after the
safety of the Republic, is for the good of those who
were our enemies, and who despitefully used us. Never
before was clemency so sublime; never before was a
rebel people surrounded by beneficence so comprehensi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>ve.
Great as was the Republic in arms, it is greater
still in the majesty of its charity.</p>

<p>So far as the Reconstruction Acts have been assailed,
I am ready to defend them against all comers. And I
repel at the outset every charge or suggestion of harshness.
They are not harsh, unless it is harsh to give
every man his due. If they are harsh, then is beneficence
harsh, then is charity harsh. It is only by outraging
every principle of justice, stifling every sympathy
with Human Rights, and discarding common sense, and,
still further, by forgetting all the sacred obligations of
country, that we can submit to see political power in
the hands of Rebels. No judgment is too terrible for
us, if we consent to the sacrifice. For the sake of the
freedman, for the sake of his former master, for the sake
of all, and for the sake of the Republic, this must not
be. Therefore were the Reconstruction Acts adopted by
immense majorities in both Houses of Congress as the
guaranty of peace. The aspiration of our candidate
was in every line and word, “Let us have peace.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two questions are presented by the enemies of these
Acts: first, on the Power of Congress; and, secondly, on
the Equal Rights of the Freedman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Too often have I asserted the plenary power of Congress
with arguments that have never been answered, to
feel it necessary now to occupy time on this head. The
case may be proved in so many ways that it is difficult
to know which to select. Whether the power is derived
from the necessity of the case, because the Rebel States
were without governments, which is the reason assigned
by Chief Justice Marshall for the jurisdiction of Congre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>ss
over the Territories,&mdash;or from the universal rights
of war, following the subjection of belligerents on land,&mdash;or
from the obligation of the United States to guaranty
a republican government to each State,&mdash;or from the
Constitutional Amendment abolishing Slavery, with its
supplementary clause conferring upon Congress power
to enforce this abolition,&mdash;whether the power is derived
from one or all of these bountiful sources, it is
clear that it exists. As well say that the power over
the Territories, the war power, the guaranty power,
and the power to enforce the abolition of Slavery, do
not exist; as well say that the Constitution itself does
not exist.</p>

<p>If any confirmation of this irresistible conclusion
were needed, it might be found in the practical admissions
of Andrew Johnson, who, while perversely
usurping the power of Reconstruction, did it in the
name of the Nation. In the prosecution of this usurpation,
he summoned conventions of delegates made
eligible by his proclamation, and chosen by electors invested
by him with the right of suffrage; and through
these conventions, to which he gave the law by telegraphic
wire, he assumed to institute local governments.
Thus has Andrew Johnson testified to the power of the
Nation over Reconstruction, while, with an absurdity
of pretension which history will condemn even more
than any contemporary judgment, he assumed that he
was the Nation. His usurpation has been overthrown,
but his testimony to the power of the Nation remains.
When the Nation speaks, it is by Congress,&mdash;as the
Roman Republic spoke by its Senate and people, <i>Senatus
Populusque Romanus</i>, in whose name went forth those
great decrees which ruled the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>In considering the constitutionality of the Reconstruction
Acts, there is a distinction, recognized by repeated
judgments of the Supreme Court, which has not been
sufficiently regarded, even by our friends. The Rebel
Party, especially in their platform at New York, forget
it entirely. They tell us that the Reconstruction Acts
are “unconstitutional, revolutionary, and void,” and Wade
Hampton boasts that he prompted this declaration. I
have already exhibited the power of Congress in four
different sources; but beyond these is the principle,
<i>that Congress, in the exercise of political powers, cannot
be questioned</i>. So says the Supreme Court. Thus it has
been decided, in general terms, “that the action of <i>the
political branches</i> of the Government in a matter that
belongs to them is conclusive.”<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> And in the famous
case of <i>Luther</i> v. <i>Borden</i>, it is announced, that, where the
National Government interferes with the domestic concerns
of a State, “the Constitution of the United States,
as far as it has provided for an emergency of this kind,
<i>has treated the subject as political in its nature, and
placed the power in the hands of that department</i>”; and
it is further added, that “its decision is binding on every
other department of Government, and could not be
questioned in a judicial tribunal.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> In the face of these
peremptory words, it is difficult to see what headway
can be made in contesting the validity of the Reconstruction
Acts, except by arms. If ever a question was
political, it is this. It is political in every aspect, whether
regarded as springing from the necessity of the case,
from the rights of war, from the obligation to guaranty
a republican government, or from the power to enforce
the abolition of Slavery. Never before was any question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
presented so completely political. Reconstruction is as
political as the war, or as any of the means for its conduct.
It is political from beginning to end. It is nothing,
if not political. Therefore, by unassailable precedents
under the Constitution, are these Acts fixed and
secured so that no court can touch them,&mdash;nothing but
the war which Mr. Blair has menaced.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Equal Rights conferred upon the freedman are all
placed under this safeguard. Congress has done this
great act of justice, and, thank God, it cannot be undone.
It has already taken its place in the immortal
covenants of history, and become a part of the harmonies
of the universe. As well attempt to undo the Declaration
of Independence, or suspend the law of gravitation.
This cannot be. The bloody horrors of San Domingo,
where France undertook to cancel Emancipation, testify
with a voice of wail that a race once lifted from Slavery
cannot be again degraded. Human Rights, when at last
obtained, cannot be wrested back without a conflict in
which God will rage against the oppressor.</p>

<p>But I do not content myself with showing the essential
stability of this measure of Reconstruction. I defend
it in all respects,&mdash;not only as an act of essential
justice, without which our Nation would be a deformity,
but as an irresistible necessity, for the sake of that security
without which peace is impossible. It is enough
that justice commanded it; but the public exigency left
no opportunity for any fine-spun system, with educational
or pecuniary conditions, even if this were consistent
with the fundamental principle that “all just
government stands only on the consent of the governed.”
As the strong arms of this despised race had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>been needed
for the safety of the Republic, so were their votes needed
now. The cause was the same. Without them loyal
governments would fail. They could not be organized.
To enfranchise those only who could read and write or
pay a certain tax was not enough. They were too few.
All the loyal are needed at the ballot-box to counterbalance
the disloyal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was at this time, and under this pressure, that conditions,
educational or pecuniary, were seen to be inadmissible;
and many, considering the question in the
light of principle, were led to ask, if, under any circumstances,
such conditions are just. Surely an unlettered
Unionist is better than a Rebel, however learned
or wise, and on all practical questions will vote more
nearly right. If there is to be exclusion, let it be of
the disloyal, and not of the loyal. Nobody can place
the value of education too high; but is it just to make
it the prerequisite to any right of citizenship? There
are many, whose only school has been the rough
world, in whom character is developed to a rare degree.
There are freedmen unable to read or write who are
excellent in all respects. If willing to reject such persons
as allies, can you justly exclude them from participation
in the Government? Can you justly exclude any
good citizen from such participation?</p>

<p>It is recorded of the English statesman, Charles James
Fox, that, after voting at a contested election, and finding
his coachman, who had driven him to the polls,
voting the other way, he protested pleasantly that the
coachman should have told him in advance how he was
to vote, that the two might have paired off and stayed
at home. Here is Fox at the polls neutralized by hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>s
coachman. A similar incident is told of Judge Story,
here in Cambridge. Both stories have been used to discredit
suffrage by the people. They have not this effect
on my mind. On the contrary, I find in them a beautiful
illustration of that Equality before the Law which is
the promise of republican institutions. At the ballot-box
the humblest citizen is the equal of the great statesman
or the great judge. If this seems unreasonable, it must
not be forgotten that the eminent citizen exercises an
influence which is not confined to his vote. It extends
with his fame or position, so that, though he has only a
single vote, there are many, perhaps multitudes, swayed
by his example. This is the sufficient compensation for
talent and education exerted for the public weal, without
denying to anybody his vote. The common man
may counterbalance the vote of the great statesman or
great judge, but he cannot counterbalance this influence.
The common man has nothing but his vote. Who would
rob him of this?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far I have shown the Reconstruction Acts to be
constitutional, natural, and valid, in contradiction to the
Rebel platform, asserting them to be “unconstitutional,
revolutionary, and void.” But these Acts may be seen
in other aspects. I have shown what they accomplish.
See now what they prevent; and here is another series
of questions, every one of which is an issue on which
you are to vote.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Are you ready for the revival of Slavery? I put this
question plainly; for this is involved in the irreversibility
of the Reconstruction Acts. Let these be overthrown
or abandoned, and I know no adequate safeguard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
against an outrageous oppression of the freedman,
which will be Slavery under another name. The original
type, as received from Africa and perpetuated here,
might not appear; but this is not the only form of the
hateful wrong. Not to speak of peonage, as it existed in
Mexico, there is a denial of rights, with exclusion from
all participation in the Government and subjection to
oppressive restraints, which of itself is a most direful
slavery, under which the wretched bondman smarts as
beneath the lash. And such a slavery has been deliberately
planned by the Rebels. It would be organized, if
they again had power. Of this there can be no doubt.
The evidence is explicit and authentic.</p>

<p>I have here a Congressional document, containing the
cruel legislation of the Rebel States immediately after
the close of the Rebellion, under the inspiration of the
Johnson governments.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Here are its diabolical statutes,
fashioned in the spirit of Slavery, with all that heartlessness
which gave to Slavery its distinctive character.
The emancipated African, shut out from all participation
in the Government, despoiled of the ballot, was enmeshed
in a web of laws which left him no better than
a fly in the toils of a spider. If he moved away from
his place of work, he was caught as a “vagrant”; if he
sought work as a mechanic or by the job, he was constrained
by the requirement of a “license”; if he complained
of a white man, he was subjected to the most
cunning impediments; if he bought arms for self-defence,
he was a violator of law;&mdash;and thus, wherever he went,
or whatever he attempted, he was a perpetual victim.
In Mississippi he could not “rent or lease any lands o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>r
tenements except in incorporated towns or cities,” thus
keeping him a serf attached to the soil of his master.
Looking at these provisions critically, it appears, that,
while pretending to regulate vagrants, apprentices, licenses,
and civil rights, the freedman was degraded to
the most abject condition; and then, under a pretence
for the public peace, he was shut out from opportunities
of knowledge, and also from keeping arms, while he was
subjected to odious and exceptional punishments, as the
pillory, the stocks, the whipping-post, and sale for fine
and costs. Behind all these was violence, assassination,
murder, with the Ku-Klux-Klan constituting the lawless
police of this new system. The whole picture is too
horrible; but it is true as horrible. In the face of this
unanswerable evidence, who will say that it was not
proposed to revive Slavery? To call such a condition
Liberty is preposterous. If not a slave of the old type,
the freedman was a slave of a new type, invented by his
unrepentant master as the substitute for what he had
surrendered to the power of the Nation. Beginning with
a caste as offensive and irreligious as that of Hindostan,
and adding to it the pretensions of an oligarchy in government,
the representatives of the old system were preparing
to trample upon an oppressed race. The soul
sickens at the thought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With all this indubitable record staring us in the
eyes, with the daily report of inconceivable outrage
darkening the air, with wrong in every form let loose
upon the long-suffering freedman, General Lee breaks
the respectable silence of his parole to deny that “the
Southern people are hostile to the negroes, and would
oppress them, if in their power to do it.” The report, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>he
asserts, is “entirely unfounded,”&mdash;that is the phrase,&mdash;“entirely
unfounded”; and then he dwells on the old
patriarchal relation, with the habit from childhood of
“looking upon them with kindness” (witness the history
of Slavery in its authentic instances!); and then
he insists that “the change in the relations of the two
races has wrought no change in feelings towards them,”
that “without their labor the land of the South would
be comparatively unproductive, and therefore <i>self-interest
would prompt the whites of the South to extend to the
negroes care and protection</i>.” Here is the threadbare pretension
with which we were so familiar through all the
dreary days of the old Barbarism, now brought forward
by the Generalissimo of the Rebellion to vindicate the
new,&mdash;and all this with an unabashed effrontery, which
shows, that, in surrendering his sword, he did not surrender
that insensibility to justice and humanity which
is the distinctive character of the slave-master. The
freedman does not need the “care and protection” of
any such person. He needs the rights of an American
citizen; and you are to declare by your votes if he shall
have them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The opposition to the Reconstruction Acts manifests
itself in an inconceivable brutality, kindred to that of
Slavery, and fit prelude to the revival of this odious
wrong. Shall this continue? Outrage in every form
is directed against loyal persons, without distinction of
color. It is enough that a man is a patriot for Rebels
to make war upon him. Insulted, abused, and despoiled
of everything, he is murdered on the highway, on the
railway, or, it may be, in his own house. Nowhere is
he safe. The terrible atrocity of these acts is aggr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>avated
by the rallying cries of the murderers. If the victim is
black, then it is a “war of races”; if white, then he is
nothing but a “carpet-bagger”; and so, whether black
or white, he is a victim. History has few scenes of
equal guilt. Persecution in all its untold cruelties, ending
in martyrdom, rages over a wide-spread land.</p>

<p>If there be a “war of races,” as is the apologetic defence
of the murderers, then it is war declared and carried
on by whites. The other race is inoffensive and
makes no war, asking only its rights. The whole pretension
of a “war of races” is an invention to cover the
brutality of the oppressors. Not less wicked is the loud-mouthed
attack on immigrants, whom Rebels choose to
call “carpet-baggers,”&mdash;that is, American citizens, who,
in the exercise of the rights of citizenship, carry to the
South the blood, the capital, and the ideas of the North.
This term of reproach does not belong to the Northerner
alone. The carpet-bag is the symbol of our whole population:
there is nobody who is not a “carpet-bagger,” or
at least the descendant of one. Constantly the country
opens its arms to welcome “carpet-baggers” from foreign
lands. And yet the cry ascends that “carpet-baggers”
are to be driven from the South. Here permit me to
say, that, if anybody is driven from anywhere, it will
not be the loyal citizen, whether old or new.</p>

<p>On all this you are to vote. It will be for you to determine
if there shall be peace between the two races,
and if American citizens shall enjoy everywhere within
the jurisdiction of the Republic all the rights of citizenship,
free from harm or menace, and with the liberty of
uttering their freest thoughts.</p>

<p>There is another issue at this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>election. It is with
regard to the unpatriotic, denationalizing pretensions of
State Rights. In their name was the Rebellion begun,
and now in their name is every measure of Reconstruction
opposed. Important as are the functions of a State
in the administration of local government, especially in
resisting an overbearing centralization, they must not be
exalted above the Nation in its own appropriate sphere.
Great as is the magic of a State, there is to my mind a
greater magic in the Nation. The true patriot would
not consent to see the sacrifice of the Nation more than
the true mother before King Solomon would consent to
see the sacrifice of her child. It is as a Nation&mdash;all
together making one&mdash;that we have a place at the
council-board of the world, to excite the pride of the
patriot and the respect of foreign powers. It is as a
Nation that we can do all that becomes a civilized government;
and “who dares do more is none.” But all
this will be changed, just in proportion as any State
claims for itself a sovereignty which belongs to all, and
reduces the Nation within its borders to be little more
than a tenant-at-will,&mdash;just in proportion as the National
Unity is assailed or called in question,&mdash;just in
proportion as the Nation ceases to be a complete and
harmonious body, in which each State performs its ancillary
part, as hand or foot to the natural body. There
is an irresistible protest against such a sacrifice, which
comes from the very heart of our history. It was in the
name of “the good people of these Colonies,” called “one
people,” that our fathers put forth the Declaration of
Independence, with its preamble of Unity, and its dedication
of the new Nation to Human Rights. And now
it is for us, their children, to keep this Unity, and to
perform all the national promises thus announced. The
Nation is solemnly pledged to guard its Unity, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
make Human Rights coextensive with its boundaries.
Nor can it allow any pretension of State Rights to interfere
with this commanding duty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is still another issue, which is subordinate to
Reconstruction and dependent upon it, so, indeed, as to
be a part of it. I refer to the Financial Question, with
the menace of Repudiation in different forms. Let the
Reconstruction Acts be maintained in peace, in other
words, let peace be established in the Rebel States,
and the menace of Repudiation will disappear from the
scene,&mdash;none so poor to do it reverence. If it find any
acceptance now, it is only in that revolutionary spirit
which assails all the guaranties of peace. Repudiation
of the Reconstruction Acts, with all their securities for
Equal Rights, is naturally followed by repudiation of
the National Debt. The Acts and the Debt are parts
of one system, being the means and price of peace. So
strongly am I convinced of the potency of this influence,
that I do not doubt the entire practicability of
specie payments on the fourth of July next after the
inauguration of General Grant.</p>

<p>Nay, more, it is my conviction, not only that we <i>can</i>
have specie payments at that time, but that we <i>ought</i> to
have them. If we can, we ought; for this is nothing
but the honest payment of what we owe. A failure to
pay may be excused, but never justified. Our failure
was originally sanctioned only under the urgency of
war; but this sanction cannot extend beyond the urgency.
It is sometimes said that necessity renders an
action just, and Latin authority is quoted: <i>Id enim
justissimum quod necessarium</i>. But it is none the less
untrue. Necessity may excuse an action not in itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
just, but it is without the force to render it just; for
justice is immutable. The taking of the property of
another under the instigation of famine is excused, and
so is the taking of the property of citizens by the Government
during war,&mdash;in both cases from necessity.
But as the necessity ceases, the obligations of justice
revive. Necessity has no rights, but only privileges,
which disappear with the exigency. Therefore do I say
that the time has passed when the Nation can be excused
for refusing to pay according to its promise. But
it is vain to expect this important change from a political
party which emblazons Repudiation on its banners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is in two conspicuous forms that Repudiation
flaunts: first, in the barefaced proposition to tax the
bonds, contrary to the contract at the time the money
was lent; and the other, not less barefaced, to pay interest-bearing
bonds with greenbacks, or, in other words,
mere promises to pay without interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The exemption from taxation was a part of the original
obligation, having, of course, a positive value, which
entered into the price of the bond at the time of subscription.
This additional price was taken from the
pocket of the subscriber and transferred to the National
Treasury, where it has been used for the public advantage.
It is so much property to the credit of the bond-holder,
which it is gravely proposed to confiscate. Rebel
property you will not confiscate; but you are considering
how to confiscate that of the loyal citizen. Taxation
of the bonds is confiscation.</p>

<p>The whole case can be stated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>with perfect simplicity.
To tax the bonds is to break the contract <i>because you
have the power</i>. It is an imitation of the Roman governor,
a lieutenant of Cæsar, who, after an agreement by
the people of Gaul to pay a certain subsidy monthly,
arbitrarily changed the number of months to fourteen.
The subtraction from the interest by taxation is kindred
in dishonesty to the increase of the Gaulish subsidy by
adding to the months. Of course, in private contracts
between merchant and merchant no such thing could be
done. But there can be no rule of good faith binding on
private individuals which is not binding on the Nation,
while there are exceptional reasons for extraordinary
scrupulousness on the part of the Nation. As the transaction
is vast, and especially as the Nation is conspicuous,
what is done becomes an example to the world
which history cannot forget. A Nation cannot afford
to do a mean thing. There is another reason, founded
on the helpless condition of the creditor, who has no
power to enforce his claim, whether of principal or interest.
It was Charles James Fox who once exclaimed
against a proposition kindred to that now made: “Oh,
no, no! His claims are doubly binding who trusts to
the rectitude of another.” This is only according to an
admitted principle in the Laws of War, constraining the
stronger power to the best of faith in dealing with a
weaker power, because the latter is without the capacity
to redress a wrong. This benign principle, borrowed
from the Laws of War, cannot be out of place in the
Laws of Peace; and I invoke it now as a sufficient protection
against taxation of the bonds, even if common
sense in its plainest lessons, and the rule of right in its
most imperious precepts, did not forbid this thing.</p>

<p>The cheat of paying interest-bearing bonds in promi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>ses
without interest is kindred in character to that of
taxing the bonds. It is flat Repudiation. No subtlety
of technicality, no ingenuity of citation, no skill in arranging
texts of statutes, can make it anything else. It
is so on the face, and it is so the more the transaction
is examined. Here again I invoke that rule of conduct
to a weaker party, and I insist, that, if, from any failure
of explicitness excluding all contrary conclusion, there
can be any reason for Repudiation, every such suggestion
must be dismissed as the frightful well-spring of
disastrous consequences impossible to estimate, while it
is inconsistent with that Public Faith which is the supreme
law.</p>

<p>Elsewhere I have considered this question so fully,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
that I content myself now with conclusions only. Do
you covet the mines of Mexico and Peru, the profits of
extended commerce, or the harvest of your own teeming
fields? All these and more you will multiply infinitely,
if you will keep the Public Faith inviolate. Do you
seek stability in the currency, with the assurance of
solid business, so that extravagance and gambling speculations
shall cease? This, too, you will have through
the Public Faith. Just in proportion as this is discredited,
the Nation is degraded and impoverished. If nobody
had breathed Repudiation, we should all be richer,
and the national debt would be at a lower interest, saving
to the Nation millions of dollars annually. Talk of
taxation; here is an annual tax of millions imposed by
these praters of Repudiation.</p>

<p>Careless of all the teachings of history, you are exhorted
to pay the national debt in greenbacks, knowing
that this can be done only by creating successive
batches, counted by hundreds of millions, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> will
bring our currency to the condition of Continental
money, when a night’s lodging cost a thousand dollars,
or the condition of the French <i>assignats</i>, the paper currency
of the Revolution, which was increased to a fearful
amount, precisely as it is now proposed to increase
ours, until the story of Continental money was repeated.
Talk of clipping the coin, or enfeebling it with alloy,
as in mediæval times; talk of the disgraceful frauds
of French monarchs, who, one after another in long
succession, debased their money and swore the officers
of the Mint to conceal the debasement; talk of persistent
reductions in England, from Edward the First
to Elizabeth, until coin was only the half of itself;
talk of unhappy Africa, where Mungo Park found that
a gallon of rum, which was the unit of value, was half
water;&mdash;talk of all these; you have them on a colossal
scale in the cheat of paying bonds with greenbacks.
If not taught by our own memorable experience, when
Continental money, which was the currency of the time,
was lost, like the river Rhine at its mouth, in an enormous
outstretched quicksand, then be taught by the
experience of another country. Authentic history discloses
the condition to which France was reduced. Carlyle,
in his picturesque work on the Revolution, says:
“There is, so to speak, no trade whatever, for the time
being. <i>Assignats</i>, long sinking, emitted in such quantities,
sink now with an alacrity beyond parallel.” The
hackney-coachman on the street, when asked his fare,
replied, “Six thousand livres.”<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> And still the <i>assignats</i>
sunk, until at last the nation was a pauper. The Directory,
invested for the time with supreme power, on repairing
to the palace of the Luxembourg, found it without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
a single article of furniture. Borrowing from the
door-keeper a rickety table, an inkstand, and a sheet of
letter-paper, they draughted their first official message,
announcing the new government. There was not a solitary
piece of coin in the Treasury; but there was a printing-press
at command. <i>Assignats</i> were fabricated in the
night, and sent forth in the morning wet from the press.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
At last they ended in nothing,&mdash;but not until a great
and generous people was enveloped in bankruptcy and
every family was a sufferer. Bankruptcy has its tragedies
hardly inferior to those which throb beneath the
“sceptred pall.”</p>

<p>Similar misconduct among us must result in similar
consequences, with all the tragedies of bankruptcy. Not
a bank, not a corporation, not an institution of charity,
which would not suffer,&mdash;each sweeping multitudes into
the abyss which it could not avoid. Business would be
disorganized, values would be uncertain; nobody would
know that the paper in his pocket to-day would buy
a dinner to-morrow. There is no limit to the depreciation
of inconvertible paper. Down, down it descends, as
the plummet, to the bottom, or up, up, as the bubble in
the air, until, whether down or up, it disappears. It is
hard to think of the poor, or of those who depend on
daily wages, under the trials of this condition. The rich
may, for the time, live from their abundance; but the
less favored class can have no such refuge. Therefore,
for the poor, and for all who labor, do I now plead,
when I ask that you shall not hearken to this painful
proposition.</p>

<p>I plead, als<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>o, for the business of the country. So long
as the currency continues in its present uncertainty, it
cannot answer the demands of business. It is a diseased
limb, no better than what is known in India as a
“Cochin leg,” or an excrescence not unlike the pendulous
goitre which is the pitiful sight of an Alpine village.
But it must be uncertain, unless we have peace.
Therefore, for the sake of the currency, do I unite with
our candidate in his longing. Business must be emancipated.
How often are we told by the lawyers, in a saying
handed down from antiquity, that “a wretched servitude
exists where the law is uncertain”! But this is not
true of the law only. Nothing short of that servitude
which denies God-given rights can be more wretched
than the servitude of an uncertain currency. And now
that, by the blessing of God, we are banishing that terrible
wrong which was so long the curse and shame of
our Nation, let us apply ourselves to this other servitude,
whose yoke we are all condemned to bear in daily
life.</p>

<p>Looking into the travels of Marco Polo in the thirteenth
century, you will find that he encountered in
China paper money on a large scale, being an inconvertible
currency standing on the credit of the Grand
Khan, not unlike our greenbacks. Describing the celestial
city of Kin-sai, the famous traveller says, “The
inhabitants are idolaters, and they use paper money”;
and then describing another celestial city, Ta-pin-zu,
he says, “The inhabitants worship idols, and use paper
money.”<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> I know not if Marco Polo intended by this
association to suggest any dependence of paper money
upon the worship of idols. It is enough that he puts
them together. To my mind they are equally forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
by the Ten Commandments. If one Commandment enjoins
upon us not to worship any graven image, does not
another say expressly, “Thou shalt not steal”?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is another consideration, which I have reserved
for the last, and which I would call an issue in the
pending election. It is nothing less than the good name
of the Republic, and its character as an example to the
Nations. All this is directly in question. If you are
true to the great principles of Equal Rights, declared by
our fathers as the foundation of just government,&mdash;if
you stand by the freedman and maintain him in well-earned
citizenship,&mdash;if you require full payment of the
national debt in coin, principal and interest, at the pleasure
of the holder, so that the Republic shall have the
crown of perfect honesty, as also of perfect freedom,&mdash;I
do not doubt that it will exercise a far-reaching sway.
Nothing captivates more than the example of virtue,&mdash;not
even the example of vice. <i>By this sign conquer</i>:
by fidelity to declared principles, by the performance of
all promises, by a good name. Then will American history
supply the long-sought definition of a Republic,
and our Western star will illumine the Nations.</p>

<p>Reverse the picture, let the Rebel Party prevail, and
what do we behold? The bonds of the Nation repudiated,
and the Equal Rights of the freedman, which are
nothing but bonds of the Nation, repudiated also. Alas!
the example of the Republic is lost, and our Western
star is quenched in darkness. But this cannot be without
a shock, as when our first parents tasted the forbidden
fruit:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,</div>
<div class="verse">Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe</div>
<div class="verse">That all was lost.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The shock will begin at home; but it will spread wherever
there are hearts to thrill with anguish. The struggling
people in foreign lands, now turned to us with
hope, will sink in despair as they observe the disastrous
eclipse.</p>

<p>I would not seem too confident in the destinies of my
country; but I cannot doubt, that, if only true to herself,
there is nothing too vast for her peaceful ambition.
Here again I catch the aspiration of our leader in war,
“Let us have peace.” Out of peace will spring all
else. Abroad there will be welcome and acceptance,
with the might of our example constantly increasing.
At home there will be safety and opportunity for all
within our borders, with freedom of speech, freedom
of the press, freedom of travel, and the equal rights
of citizenship, like the rights of the national creditor,
all under the perpetual safeguard of that Public Faith
which is the golden cord of the Republic. Let despots
break promises, but not our Republic. A Republic is
where every man has his due. Equality of rights is the
standing promise of Nature to man, and the Republic
has succeeded to this promise.</p>

<p>In harmony with the promise of Nature is the promise
of our fathers, recorded in the Declaration of Independence,
to which the Republic has succeeded also.
It is the twofold promise, first, that all are equal in
rights, and, secondly, that just government stands only
on the consent of the governed,&mdash;being the two great
political commandments on which hang all laws and
constitutions. Keep these truly, and you will keep
all. Write them in your statutes; write them in
your hearts. <i>This is the great and only final settlement
of all existing questions.</i> Under its kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> influence
the past Rebellion will disappear, alike in its
principles and its passions; future Rebellion will be
impossible; and there will be a peace never to be
disturbed. To this sublime consecration of the Republic
let me aspire. With nothing less can I be content.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
